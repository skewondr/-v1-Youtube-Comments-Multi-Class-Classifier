As they say now, "An Apple a year, 
design: barely
I have an iPhone 6s+ 
glass is glass and glass breaks
Can I ask where the “hey, what’s up guys? MKBHD here” went?
Nothing says a new iPhone review like the words "slight improvements"
in the Past we bought phones with Camera. Now we're  buying Cameras with phones
"upgraded the water resistance a bit"
"Let's be honest; Glass is glass." - As a technical estimator for specialist glass, I hate you. Haha.
Me: man im finally going to upgrade from my iphone 6
Apple is focused on 4 major things.
iPhone 11 Pro: Stove
11:45 his dog is literally ready to pose 😂 how adorable! ❤️
The phone that might switch me from Android.
"Glass is glass" is the creeper of the tech community
Fact is no phone can beat this beast......
This almost looks like you've put yourself on a green screen..
1:26 “I’m just happy we got memes out of it...”
Im following you a few years now, your production quality is "top notch" :)
Think I'm just gonna hold out until Super Retina XDR Display Turbo Championship Edition
I‘d love to see a „Whats on my iPhone“ from you!
Using an iPhone 6, I feel like I’m in the stone ages. 😐
I was like "I know that intro music" and then I realized it.. It's Casey Neistat's intro from 368!
"It doesn't look horrible" - about a phone which costs a 1000$...
Damm that intro was more pro than the phone itself 🔥🔥🔥
I don’t need it
I’m going for 3 days now on 1 charge on my 11.
7:23 - your dog is the cutest thing ever! 🐶 Also, nice review!
I watched the intro like 10 times ts's soo smooth
Your intro was nuts. This is why you always win best tech YouTuber, quality is just madness
I wish Apple would make a phone I could hold without having a case or skin. Too slippery
1:18   "A WILD IKEA PLANT APPEARS!"
11:04 that backdoor light, Pixel 3 blew it.
intro music intros
"Apple says this is the toughest glass in any smartphone, I'm not gonna test that" 
I went on the apple website and it said 'Pro' so many times I actually got a migraine
It's funny how the Apple logo at the top on the iPhone XS already looks off.,
NEW IPHONE 11 FEATURES
Anyone know what the intro song is? Sounds 🔥
Apple : The World toughest glass..
I wish he would actually explain this goddamn phone instead of expecting us to know last years. “A little bit more than the last model” i don’t know what it had ???
That "Casey Neistat"s intro music
ok please stop standing over those stairs.
Youtube recommendations: Iphone 11 pro  review. 
I don't need three cameras to know that I'm ugly
Anyone else upgrading from the iPhone 1 to the 11 Pro?
Still ugly af. I’ll keep my old phone that dies in 3 hours. At least it looks good 😂
What if God was one of us??
nice intro, was it inspired by theverge? (or other way around 🤔) 
Wallapaper link please!
come on man give link of the every wallpaper on your description
Getting a Slickwraps Skin
6:55 for the cameras, thank me later
iPhone 11pro: *we have the ”World's Toughest Glass” *
@2:47 That screen looks massacred with scratches.  You give it to JerryRig or something?
"glass is glass and glass can break" hmm where have u heard that🤨
No one is gonna talk about how good the intro was?
I'm waiting for Android phone to copy that camera features, so I can have it without selling my kidney 😂
1:53 "glass is glass"
The camera outside preview thing you can turn it offf in setting. I tried it before.
I’m going to have to get the wife a weekend job. 🤣
I felt that LEEEEANNNN to unlock a phone on a desk lollll
I love that framing feature honestly that with the grid overlay enabled=perfectly centered images. It drives me crazy if my subject is not perfectly centered.
Heart Says Apple 
The phone feels so good in my hands!
13:47-END - 🔥Preach!!!!
Could you link the wallpaper. Looks insane
Listening to crispy waveform on the equally crispy dark mode on iOS 13
Apple: iPhone 11 has the toughest glass in any phone
3:39 "The tasteful thickness of it...Oh my god, it even has a water mark."
That intro...so many things going on that just made my brain happy. Between the music (I see what you did there) and the shot....B-E-A-Utiful!
6:50 Aye Off the Pill Podcast💯
These videos looks so futuristic, the music, the animations, the quality. You're a genius Marques
Omg he didn't say "what's up guys mkbhd here" at the beginning
0:12 wait the logo is ticking like a clock
Marques, you need to hold a quarter next to the phone. In your hands it looks like an iPhone 5. Nice review!
So far the truest review of iPhone that I've ever seen♥️♥️ Loved it MKBHD💯💯
7:23 camera test
I edited this comment so no one will know what it was
I’m on an XR, regret choosing it over the XS, might swap to the Pro since I love that green and I’d love a better quality screen.
5:08 Thumbs up for the text edit shortcut!!!... what an amazing revelation. <behind the curve apparently>
Laugh how you always say "very slightly"
That's an epic intro if I've ever seen one before
Glass is glass, you've got to protect it.
Man. Your reviews are edited the best I’ve ever seen and seeing how far you’ve came and following you since 2013. It makes me watch to start up but i dont know where to begin
Just came back for the intro🔥
Anyone know where I can get that wallpaper at 2:30
That phone looks so small in his hands lmao
When you watch a Marques Brownlee video and the music makes you think of Casey Neistat’s 368 Intro
I want it for my photos 🤣 but honestly can't really get it just for that I'm going to wait for some crazy upgrades like next year or 2021
Damn iPhone 11 pro takes really good pics you can even see how dry Marques fingers are lmao 7:32
While watching I totally forgot that I clicked on this to see camera quality.
shout out to allta for the liiiittt! music background intro!
1:48... NO
7:05 for cameras
dank! that's a 368 intro soundtrack
That’s an awesome honest review
Still waiting to be able open 2 apps at the same time like on Samsung.... 🙃
A wise man said:
6:38 that is the biggest flex i have seen in a LONG time
Apple introduces the Glass Top Stove phone
The intro and the music is lit af 🔥🔥🔥
8:37 “slower glass” 
I'm basically going to spend $1300 on a phone and $85 a month to scroll through Twitter and not get text back.
hey you used casey's into tune
Love the intro ❤️
So far the truest review of iPhone that I've ever seen♥️♥️ Loved it MKBHD💯💯
I’m still getting it even if it sadly isn’t too “pro” upgrading from the 8+
Apple : This is the toughest glass on a smartphone!
Wow, such a good and quality review!
A fidget spinner camera design hahaha, uggly phone AF
Haha listening to the intro I thought I was watching Casey!
I’ll stick with my XS
“Glass is glass, its still scratches at LEVEL 6 with a deeper groove at LEVEL 7”
6:49 nigihiga podcast
I won’t upgrade from my iPhone 8 until apple design a phone without a notch at the top of the screen, and without a protruding camera.
0:22 you used the 368 intro music!
That opening sequence was just DOPE!!!
All i could think of through the intro was casey's 368
we need more cameras on the back, 5 at least
It's my birthday, if u can I would like a shout out or something but thanks for the awesome videos
3d touch will always be remembered as the lame innovation
The intro was solid 👌
Man the production quality of these videos is just getting better and better, I've been watching this dude for Years!
I thought it was me when I use the ultra wide camera on my 11 the quality isn’t as good as it is with the standard lens. Glad I wasn’t trippin
I just got my 11 Pro Max and the screen when looking at it straight on seems to have a yellow tint that my X didn’t have, seems odd.
Looks like this year I'll say the same as last year, let's see what's coming next year :))
Hey Marques, dope video! I just wanted to ask if there will be an Apple Watch 5 review?
Notch- I'm dying..
It's the best Intro I've ever seen😍😍
CAN WE APPRECIATE THE CINEMATOGRAPHY WITH THAT INTRO! I got goosebumps lol
I thought the battery life improvement was related to the new 7nm processor
You can turn of the photo framing (out of frame) in the Camera settings in Settings.
Ive been waiting for "the next iPhone" for like 5 years but they keep releasing the same one lmao
Who's here after seeing PIXEL 4 review ?
Love the intro music 🎵
Where did you get that background from? Looks dope.
Apple watch series 5 review please!
Tough Decision: What should one buy for 999$ ?
this is dope! almost as good as my review on the iPhone 11 pro ;)
Wait until 2021.  iPhone is planning to put a 24 MP massive lens 📷 in the center rear and put DSLR’s out of business
Are you secretly 21 savage? You sound so much like 21 savage
is it just me or have I heard that intro song in a Casey video...
When he said Apple focused on four things I thought he was going to say:
hey i don’t know if you’ll see this, but i just watched some of your decade old videos. you’ve come so far and you still have just as much passion about your topic. you’re incredibly inspiring and proof that everybody should follow their dreams. much love!
We call it 
That intro 🔥
1:52 Glass is glass and glass breaks
It made me laugh that you did the intro by getting numerous people to move objects out of the way
Sir what about huwaei mate 30 
I couldnt agree more. Nothing about this phone screams PRO. Gotta love the  marketing strategy though, Super Retina XDR lol really
Apple do great job in 2019
$1099 for a smartphone with 64GB and the word “pro” in it
Almost making a long term Android user switch to this! 
What is this music playing in your background?
bet my Galaxy S 4 on that Apple will slap on 3 more cameras on the back in five years
3:46 please link that wallpaper. thx.
Oh your Tesla app is having problems with iOS 13?  Yeah we can relate to that.
that opening so was sweet
I'm so glad Apple is the cheapest phone on the market now.  I've always wanted one.
368 intro tune... Loving it
I loved the beginning of this video.
1:53 "glass is glass"
The 11 Pro Max's midnight green looks military fierce. Can't wait to get it on Wednesday w/ a wallet case!😊
iOs 13 make's my phone glitch more
Man that intro though!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
what was the song in the opening scene
i am such a spoilt consumer all because of this guy..
Still waiting for that Series 5 review...
always the best review, love!
I knew he couldn’t get through a camera review without saying it not quite as good as the pixel
That dog was posing for the pic 😂💜
Time to grab some popcorn for this comment section.
Your intro just boosted Apples sales 🔥
@mkbhd Could you plz share that wallpaper, I know unusually get your wallpapers from backdrop and Wali but can't find that one anywhere.
Leeeean 😂 And bit of a chunker!! 😂
Best review I’ve seen by far!
"Glass is glass, and glass will break"
Pretty much the same thing as always. A few incremental upgrades and that's it. Great job Tim Apple.
Those lenses lol slap a WOK on there and cook up a curry FFS🤣🤣 That's real innovation 😂
Great review! It’s definitely an awesome upgrade for me cuz i just jumped from 6s to 11 Pro 😂 so i’m beyond happy and satisfied ☺️
Waiting for iphone 11 review!!
Well, IPhone 11 opened his third eye before all humans
Hey nice Review, thx! Love your T-Shirt! Which brand is it? Best James
That Casey music intro tho.... sugar to my ears
Wow that intro was amazing.
Today I Returned my Max Pro to At&t for an Note 10+ I feel like I'm getting my Money worth now, best Display on any phone with the power to back everything up! 10/10
Smartphones cameras must be garbage to a man who uses 30,000$ camera 📷
THE KING IS HERE! there is 1000 reviews and tech video s but my guy always is the best xxxx
I wish have Iphone 4, I mean I never  have my owen  Iphone or apple product from the first till I phone 11.( not jock)
Marcus, please share the link of your wallpaper on 11Pro Max. It's gorgeous! Thanks!
Am I the only one who noticed the difference in the brightness/display?
The general consensus seems to be "it's great, but it could have been so much more." 
No tech channel has this level of attention to detail on the cinematography. I love how MKBHD videos are made to please the eye and sooth the mind.
I really like the innovative menu layout.
Intro music full fire 🔥🔥🔥💥💥
THAT INTRO WAS SO CLEAN!!!!
Just came back from Area 51 and I have a iPhone 69
5:16 wats android doin' in the background... when iPhone 11 is IOS???
How 3D touch even made it to production blows my mind. For a company that tests everything, they should have known the advantages 3D touch adds vs the cost of adding that feature.
do you recommend upgrading to the iPhone 11 pro from a Galaxys8?
Damn son that into was lit.
When you know you`re about to be watched by 3M+ people . . . . .11:49
i am still sad that it doesn't have 3d touch as someone who uses it a lot
I WANT TO OWNED THIS PHONE
This music is from Casey neistat's 368 💙
That intro is awesome.
This guy's thumb is longer than my middle finger
Look at my new camera! Sweet, and it works as a phone in an emergency too. Well, I think it does.
I noticed the thickness difference the second I picked the phone up
Watch the hand gestures at 2:37, real smooth Marques. 😅
That intro dude! sick!
a Casey intro love it!!
Hey Marques! Great video. Just felt that you didn't talk about the thickness of the phone. It looks very bulky.
Watch, next year's iPhone the same design with a fourth camera. Also extra front camera, so bigger notch 😆
Anyone after Pixel 4 launch .. 😅
Agent : How do we improve the device?
You dont have to really try, you just need to play pokemon GO...
Hahahaa iphone excellent battery l. 😁 + no fast charging WDF?!
Is that a pair of ZMF headphones on your desk? 3:15
Hey Marques! I love all your videos and reviews, as well as the effort put into the videography and editing. Would you possibly be able to do an over the phone interview with me for a school assignment? I'm Dante Hernandez an aspiring videographer and a student at Colorado Media School. It would be awesome if we could set that up. Once again, love all your stuff! Thanks.
6:39 casual flex of all devices connected to his apple id.... X'D
13:25 the one bit my mum picks up on 😭
Best Intro Ever 👏👏
Super retina display HDR,the name is pretty lame🤣🤣
Man, you're intros are just so dope! Sometimes I skip back and watch the intro for like 5 times...
MKBHD: apple says it’s the toughest glass. I’m not gonna test it...
Waste of time getting this. I’ll just keep my original iPhone X and wait for Apple to throw out updates to all models of their phones like they did with the previous update. I’ll be getting the new watch though
Casey Neistat vibes from the intro!
who like me was waiting for the camera test?
Great review. You are very personable, articulate and informed. I have an 11 Pro and appreciate the additional information that your review provided. Great job!
The f*cking intro woooooo! Nice job man, love the effort that goes in to these videos!!!!
Was up y’all ✅
Great review as always 💯
Can you please do a standard iPhone 11 review!? Would love to see the non-pro version pleaseeee
Wonder when his iPhone 11 review will drop
I felt MKBHD wanted to bash at Apple so hard in this video but controlled his temper just to avoid being excluded from Apple events + those early phones.
Me: This phone is so cool. I'm gonna buy it.😍
Watching on the iPhone 11 pro :)
These intro are craaaaaaaazyyyyyy !!
Why did they drop the 3d touch. the touch sensitive screen was also used by apps like pianos etc.
For the love of phones: our camera has a phone
Best detailed review..
Insane intro!
OMG what an intro!
That wallpaper tho (*_*)
Apple: Toughest glass in any phone.
Dat Sick Intro Though !!!
Need to win the contest need the phone thtz y typing honestly ✌👍✌👌
Can we have the link for this wallpaper ?
Hi Marques it’s been a while since you drop a video. Hope you good?
I remember how you said as a kid you wanted your video quality to eventually be on par with this Apple ads, and watching the beginning of this video, I actually thought you were showing a snippet of an apple ad.
i'll be holding on the 7 plus, nothing new
Good Video! I appreciate how you upload in 4k! Footage looks great!
One bug I experienced was trying to listen to Apple Music yesterday. When I clicked on a song it popped up “cant connect to the server”? Even tho I had 4 bars service. After about 3 or 4 minutes it worked. Never have had that problem before.
Bro that intro...
1:53 im disappointed you didn't say 
I appreciate the 11 pro, still do i enjoy my iphone8. Not switching up until my current phone dies.
MFW watching this and realizing I am not a sub... watching him since 2016 or so.
A great realistic review. 
What's that logo on his shirt and where can I buy it?
Im staying at my iphone xs max, waiting for the iphone 12. The difference is too small to change the phone.
ios launcher ❤️
The notch lol 😂
So, what about 2 kidneys? Fellas 😆
Amazing review.
Can you do another smartphone blind camera test with: oneplus 7 pro, s10+ or note10+, Huawei mate 30 pro, pixel 4 and iPhone 11 pro?
can i charge my iphone xs with my ipad charger, cuz charger from the box is too slow
I saw this today. You gotta be kidding me. The evolution on this unit is so minimal..Note10+ much nicer. This one is a bulky unit.
I was waiting for him to say glass is glass, glass and glass can break.
Your smoothest opening yet.
Screw the phone, battery, display and cameras, that dog was cute af
Apple already forgot completely it was a company of innovation.
We need the Blind Test 2.0 after the Pixel 4 and OP7T release.
God your videos just keep getting better. The cinematography is awesome. I am starting to get blinded by it, overseeing the actual informations.
i freakin' love that intro!!!!!
Me: Maybe I can buy this iPhone....
It seems now that all phone have touched the bottom low where in newness in tech has stopped. 
dude is that tech review tuesday intro??
4:52 do you use hoverboard?
That intro tho 🤪
"You don't neeeed the new iPhone" Said everyone before buying it 😁
Jersey !!! Great Review iPhone love your work 💪🏼
6:40 his devices look like an entire twitter feed
Time to trade in my XS Max 😁
0:02 what;s! THAT BLAcK MaGIC! o.O !
Apple:- "finally is bundled with 18W fast charge"
I was waiting for him to say glass is glass, glass and glass can break.
Camera review start 7:06
Feels like you oversold it.
Love the review. Thanks for sharing!
Damn! Production quality gets better every video.
I feel like I hear the same things every year
Using @Caseyneistat’s usual intro sounds huh?... I guess he won’t mind...
Noooo I actually always used 3D touch
That intro tho..... Daaaamnnn
Still rocking my 7 plus💯
Best phone according to you
Last year? it looks like the phone from 2 YEARS ago
Best camera on a smartphone until Pixel Event
I still need 3d touch....darn
I am gonna wait till iPhone 44 pro max legend ultimate pro extreme super legend 19 version to come out.
Desperately waiting for the iPhone 11 review.... Please get that out soon🙏🏼
"PRO" = No
Amazing review
man, that's an awesome intro
Intro music is from one of Casey Niestat's vlog.
who is that cute boy in 11:07 ?
I’m gonna wait until the iPhone 12 5g pro max s with the Super Retina XDR pro motion turbo display.
Hey, what about the U1 chip?!!!!, no one is talking about it !!!!!!
Wow your dog is a natural model. I've never had a dog be still for even a 1/4 of a second when trying to snap a pic lol.
the into music reminded me of Casey neistat 🤔 is he still alive?
pixels have the best design xd lol
I think I might upgrade from my 6s plus to this. iOS 13 obliterated my phone and I replaced my battery 6 months ago but after an hour of use it’s at 40%...
It would be amazing to see you shoot one of your videos using the iphone 11 combined with your dope lighting, robots and editing skills 💪
every iphone has good battery life till apple gives you an update to give you lower battery times so you can think you need to buy the newer iphone.
6:40 weird flex but okay
3:19 so cool you can see the infrared lights blinking in the "notch"!
Are we going to get an iPhone 11 review?
I've been having andriod phones all my life. And the other day I went to the apple store to check out the new phones and honestly I wasn't impressed. Not trying to hate though. I'm sure the camera is truly one of the best features. But the screen isn't high quality yet plus the notch I'm still not feeling it after all these years.i have a v30 but still not sold on buying a phone any time soon yet.
1:50 ok, I expected a much deeper reference...
" You probably don't need an iPhone 11 Pro. " 
amazing review
Mannn I just want that walllpaper on 2:34
Please do a review of the new Xiaomi Mi Mix Alpha <3!!! best looking phone period
When i heard the intro song for this vid..
I'll stick with my nokia flip phone
Yo @Marques could you please donate me an Apple laptop? 💻  am a college student and I really need one. 
Dope Intro there
Only Huawei♥️❤️
"But the good news is it doesn't seem to scratch as much as the pixel 3s matte black"
I like the notch 😂
😡Hey Siri on my AirPods 2 works less than half the time ever since the update. I’ve tried numerous ways to disconnect and connect them and I’ve come to the conclusion that it has to be iOS. When they’re not working I put them in the case and then immediately take them out and they start working again. But that doesn’t work every time. It’s A mess. 🤦‍♂️
That intro tho
Glass is glass.....
SAMSUNG : here our latest folding phone technology
Just make one lense bigger even if it looks like a hidden Mickey LOL
I’m watching a review of the phone I’m using to watch the review 😑
Maaaaan, when the review of iPhone 11????  Are you gonna make it??
Suggest add chinese subtitle :))
"I'm just happy we got memes out of it"
That intro.. 😎
I won't own an iPhone with that notch.
What are peoples views on camera vs phone video uploads to instagram? i know Instagram will reduce the quality automatically but is it worth using a camera?
I am considering this phone because I film YouTube videos. I also take a lot of close up photos. So my question is......is this the the best iPhone for me?
Apple needs to make FaceiD work in horizontal mode.
Pixel lovers are seen more on YouTube and less in the real world.
🤦‍♀️ huge step-back, Apple! 😭
So it seems like its a pretty good phone then. I currently have the XS Max so I definitely won’t be upgrading to the 11 PRO, however I’d recommend to anyone I know below an 8 to upgrade tbh, especially since iOS 13 is going to slow those phones down to the grave.
Could you share me the wallpaper? Thanks!
Dbrand skins usually look good but oh god that case is the ugliest thing I've seen
I would notice and appreciate brightness 100%
That intro tho....
Bruh these studio set textures 🙌🏾
The front screen how much scratch in normal use like in the bag. Si easy ro scratch?
Can’t wait for 2030 model iPhone. No notch
Hi, i want to know what do you do with the electronic gadgets after its review and all that? If you dont use it can you give me!!
i'm waiting for a camera which comes with a phone on it
Wait, I just noticed... So, no more "hello, MKBHD here... " ??? 🙄🙄🙄
Hey MKBHD, I have been subscribed and keeping up with a majority of your videos since 2012ish. This video, the production, the presentation, and lighting, the background, the quality is such an inspiration especially seeing where you were to where you are. Thank you for doing what you do!
I’ll pass again on this one. Still using my 7 plus and waiting for a proper upgrade..
That camera a telescope with big 👀
Just slapped dat fidget spinner at da back
Need the wallpaper!
13:25
Video was too long . Halfway through it, I got hungry so I left it playing and went to the kitchen to fix my self a sandwich. But then I found out that I'm out of mayonnaise so I went to a store. There, I saw the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in my whole life. But I'm really a shy person so I took up a three-year personality development
Nah, ill hold out until the Super Retina XDR HD For Grandma And Grandpa Sharp Colour Accurate Hue Low High Can Be Bright Student And Pro Edition Budget Expensive Superb Edition. That screen might be better
@MKBHD It is actually possible to turn the night mode off and on. Just tap on night mode sign  and a scale should be shown. All the way to the left is “Off” and on right would be maximum in seconds for the given scene situation.
You can turn on night mode, click the night mode next to the flash marques!
The Verge : we got the best intro
Y no iPhone 11 review
LOVE the Spike Lee moves with the camera!!😍😍😍😍😍👊🏽😎
Bro Great review, but could you please Link the WALLPAPER that you are using on the iphone 11 pro........
The Glossy is more slippery than this Matt Finish.
This is why competition is good, cuz even the gods at Apple can't rest forever, much like Intel had to wake up because of AMD. I wish everything and everyone had a competitor.
what if we can install Gcam on the new iphone 11 it would be the best camera on a smartphone
Hey MKBHD, 
Iphone 11pro max 7 hour battery
i focused on his chest
*slighty
I like one-handed build but also love it big screen while playing the game. So just comment to me which phone should I buy 11pro/11 pro max?
I'm still gonna get a note 9, anyone recommend good screen protectors? And a good clear case? I was thinking of actually getting a dbrand skin with a rhinoshield crash guard case
Casey neistat intro song 😍😍😍😍😍.
Waiting for that 1500-2000 nit Smartphone. I'll pay a pretty penny for it.
The Pro Max 512GB costs $2800 in Turkey. What a time to be alive!
I suppose it’s impressive but how you suppose to make Face ID faster like how you suppose to make the invisible dots that scan your face work faster
The camera actually doesn’t look as bad when there’s a cover on it
iPhone 11 is my favorite. :) One camera less, oled and 2 gb of ram... okay. But it costs 300 less! :)
8:36 slower glass ?!
stopped the video in the first minute to check for a beard comment.. 
What color is the best for the new iPhone 11?
Hey MKBHD, my friend us trying to get me a new 11 pro 256 gb but he is saying there is a shortage of phones in the USA is that true
Currently wondering if I would give up 3D touch for extra battery life; probably not since my Iphone x hasn’t died on me once yet
Hey, at least the notch doesn’t matter when you’re watching an MKBHD video...
The real review 👍🏼👍🏼
If you care about photos and a good camera you go for a Sony with Medium-format sensor
where can I find the wallpaper, you re using in this video?
Using Neistat's Intro song? Or was he using yours??
Marq(k)ues Brownlee High Definition
That’s a nice wallpaper. Where did you get it?
What a sick intro!
When apple going to bring projector on I phone.
Settings - Camera - Photos Capture Outside The Frame: "Toggle off".
Wallpaper link please!
I feel like people focus too much on what other smartphone manufacturers have, ie reverse wireless charging. The phone is the PRO lineup in the APPLE world. They cater more to current customers. For what it is, it is a great phone. I am upgrading from the 7 Plus and this will be a major upgrade for me.
idk if it was just me but i could tell the difference everytime he asked if we could tell the difference
hey.... i will drink this and then swing on you
“Do you need the iPhone 11 pro?” 
Ok Marques, we got it, you got a Tesla.
Where’s the regular iPhone 11 review brooo
The design of the camera may cause a wave, isn't it?
I want that wallpaper ! Where can i find it ?
Your intros these days damn 🔥🔥🔥🔥 gotta rewind 3 4 times before I even get into the whole video
Faster Face ID is in the OS.  The older phone got that update
You are owesome, Marques!
I can’t wait to get mine
What's the point?
Huawei Mate 30 pro vs iPhone 11 pro vs Samsung Note 10 plus vs Google Pixel 4 🤯🤯🔥
One more thing thats glitchy is when you watch youtube and scroll on related videos. Its a bit laggy and sometimes smooth. Prolly the ios 13 still a bug or some sort..
Went from iphone 8 plus to the 11 pro and battery seems about the same. I know the 11 pro is smaller than the 8 plus but i was still expecting more juice from it. Not impressed with battery life but overall I am very happy with it.
Just a thought here. I've always considered it's better if I have more battery life (they could probably double it), rather than putting bumps on the back of the phone ....
If only I could run ios on android phones.. I’d know what I should do. Without any doubt.
"glass is glass and glass will break"
that intro feels like a homage to the Verge's intro :D
Here after the Pixel 4 review
At 3:17 you can actually see the faceID lasers. Pretty neat.
You're so slick, Marques
Petition for Zack to upload durability test on iPhone 11 pro
where do I find that wallpaper=?
For once review also the lower end phones please
why that casey intro sound though?
is 5.8 screen size enough? 🙁
You can actually disable the ultra-wide POV in the settings. :) :)
I'm perfectly fine with my mate 20pro since the Google services are banned by Google anymore..... Is that worth it to change to ios by using iPhone 11pro
The best phone you can buy now
Where is iphone 11 review
Wallpaper link for the one at 4:05?
6:39 Damn. That are a LOT of devices linked to the Apple ID :D
Nice 368 Vibes in the beginning :)
Huawei mate 30 pro on the way 🔥
Please do a review on 11 as well.
Please do a blind test on the photo. Thanks. 😊
I love how smoothly you can switch between the cameras of the iPhone 11 Pro.
will you be reviewing the iphone 11, too ???
Can you review the Sony Xperia 1?
Can you do a video on best phones for food photography.!
I still got the 6s
is that the theme of casey neistat? god! heard that after a long time... :D :)
can you review the cheaper iphone 11? from your review i understand that the 11 pro is only for people who use the cameras a lot, because miss a good bunch of features available on most flagships phones atm. But i'm curious if the iphone 11 have a good enough camera(maybe comparable to the xs) and a good battery life without sacrifing too much performance compared to the xs
i am fed up with Apple Store prices, but i found an alternative, Panera Bread lost and found..it is the Mecca of wireless chargers, cables, wall blocks, and dongle adapters.
notch make its old phone never going to buy it
Does the 11 pro have a led notification light at the top of the screen?
Future Zack: 
is it a good upgrade if I have the iphone 5s
Watching on my iPhone pro max 📱
What about internet speed, downloading & uploading?
Where other brands moving to full screen displays, getting rid of notches, trying new things with their phones. 
When he said GLASS IS GLASS
2:25 what is that wallpaper I really like it
This intro tho
Oh...
The tag line should be.. 
The Verge is still stuck in 16:9 aspect ratio. Props to MKBHD for going wider.
I had my iPhone 6s for 4 years now. I decided to upgrade to an iPhone 11 Pro in gold and I must say: It was worth every penny. The camera is absolutley amazing, as is the display. The battery lasts for over 2 days. My iPhone 6s didn't even last for one whole day. Upgrading was the best decision I had this year.
Please review the Xiaomi mi mix alpha. The phone....
It’s been 5 days since this video ! Where is iphone 11 review ? Waiting....
Raise your hands OnePlus owners and lovers.
You can disable photos and videos outside of frame in the settings.
My iphone 7 was still blazing fast but i lost it on thursday :( Been rocking a 5s with a cracked screen ever since and i'm slowly dying i might have to sell my kidneys for this phone
The 11pro has finger print proof glass and from what I have seen, the glass has only broken from 11ft above being dropped onto the Pro Max.
this is just waist of f-ing money...
HELP UFD TECH. UFD TECH NEEDS HELP
Okay if that wasn’t the best damn intro I’ve ever seen… keep up the amazing work my man!!!
Not enough to be Pro
need a blind camera test definitely
This phones good but but but that’s what this video consist of 🙄 it’s a phone geez
I’m broke
Why no one's talking bout the classy intro's of MKBHD and his music choice
Apple is finally at the top again after the release of the pixel 4
5 - Fin Million Views!
Where can I find that wallpaper
Is there an iPhone 11 review coming?
So basically they realized that they already used the “s” moniker last year and they needed a new one for this year so they used “pro”
I’ll stick with my iPhone X for another year. These tiny upgrades are not worth to spend another 1000+ euros.
I wanna have this one too please.
intro music copied from caseys vdo.😆
I just watxhed 2009 mkbhd and watch this
It's either a bowling ball's finger holes or a coconut.
I love the finish on these phones. And I'm not even an Apple guy. They are matte and they are satin and the cameras are built with such precision. It clearly is a high-end product.
Solid review dude. 2020 it is....
Similar sounds more apt than familiar.
Great review, terrible "innovation"  attempt by Apple tho.
Congrats fot all the video of this channel. Always, IPHONE had a good cameras, design and features. I am still happy because, next year in the summer, I will buy a IPHONE XS MAX. It's incredible what capacities has this phone and have amazing.
Hi
watching this on my LG v30... upgrade? nahhh..
Does anyone know how to record using front and back cameras at the same time🤔
7:21
Hey Marques, love your videos! Just curious, I've noticed a lot of Americans drop the "H" sound in "Huawei," and unlike Spanish or other latin-based languages, the "H" in China's "Huawei" is very present. Just a small detail; keep up the great work!
Dang nevermind this video made me not want an iPhone anymore lol
I’ve been using android whole life, now switched to iPhone because my new car accepts only apple carplay ,I’m loving feels more natural besides of technical specs I think IOS is the the thing that makes difference
If only it wasn't so goddam heavy it would be the most appealing phone of the year (and I'm an android ho)
This is great and all but im waiting for the iphone 11s pro max thanos edition extreme.
Thanks for the video Macques.  I got the iPhone 11 Pro a few hours ago and bought it just for the camera upgrade from my iphone XS.   As per the title of your video, I agree that those who have an iphone X or XS but doesn't care about photography, video and extended battery life, I suggest you wait till Sept 2020.  Physically, it feels and look exactly the same as the iphone X.   I tried out nightmode, the photos are very noisy when I view them on a 4K monitor.  Maybe I'm not using it properly but at the moment, I think it will need a stand to get the best out of the night mode feature.
The wallpaper
Can you give the link of this wallpaper
What bulb do you use in that IKEA lamp at 4:45 ? I got the same with the stock, copper colored IKEA bulb thing and it is way too dark.
Apple every time: it’s the best phone we ever did. NO SHIT MOFO who else would make a worst phone smh 🤦‍♂️
Is the normal 11 gonna be reviewed still?
the intro is sick
does anyone know where I can get that wallpaper?
Should I buy the new 11 pro? I'd be upgrading from the HTC One M8
Honestly I think the camera is being focused on because phones are so fast now a days that it's the last thing we need to improve on besides battery life and charging speed
Doggo!!
kameraz r there 4 dr. gynoz, voyeur pleasures.lolzzzzzz
Great job! Nice review!!
Anyone have a link to that wallpaper?
2019: 
Preordered mine last night! :)
The intro remind anyone of 368??
Intro- I miss 368
Can you please share the link of the wallpaper that you have used on your iPhone 11 Pro/Max.
In Italy 11 pro max costs just 1.700 euros .. !!!
Make iPhone Great Again!
I’m glad they went back to the aluminum back
nothing he said that impressed me, at all
Link the wallpaper homie.
The intro looked like The Verge's intro for iPhone 11 Pro
Where did you get your wallpaper from
You didn't read those Terms and Conditions
What’s that wallpaper
Great review! Thanks!
That was a good non biased review! Good work Marques!
They should hire you to make a greater phone!
Please review the iPhone 11 regular version
Have you noticed a difference in signal strength? I know Apple uses intel vs Qualcomm however I would love to see if there is a difference between last years models vs this years models in signal strength
11 pro has insane battery life
The quality of that intro legitimately gave me chills.
2050 soon..
Can't wait for your Pixel 4 review! Marques Brownlee
I need that wallpaper
Amezing bro love you
4GB of RAM? Bruh.
is there distortion on ultra-wide camera?
Why does he always have to show his red camera? Ugh ! Show off !
I'm ready for a 2TB iPhone. So, I'll probably wait until 2020 and see what sizes they have.
You actually can turn of the preview of ultra wide camera in settings (according to review by Joe Allam)
I'm just happy the cams are great I'm not tryna be one of those guys that so spoiled lol notch or no notch...the notch lets me know I actually have a phone
be my daddy
What about a give away for iphone 11 pro....as in the price of iphone 11 pro...a person can buy a good pulsar sports bike in INDIA
That Intro was definitely more PRO than any new iPhone..!
368 intro music for the Casey fans (love it)
I'm actually excited for an iOS model for once since the iPhone 4
Can you do a camera comparison like with note 10 or 7t
can you send me the wallpaper Download link
Hey mkbhd. Will you be doing a iPhone 11 full review?
Wait until they roll out the update where the camera units start spinning and my beard hairs can get trimmed
Dark theme?
by a new iphone to watch videos about a new iphone
What does he mean at 8:36 “slower glass”?
What color for the 11 pro max did you go for the midnight green or the space gray
You used to share your Wallpaper in almost every video, loved that. What happened to that?
Very nice video 👍🏽.. Good Explain Marques IPhone 11 pro good also compare withe iPhone 10 xs side by side 💖👌🏽 I will hop soon I puy iPhone 11 pro 📱
meh, took my 11 pro max back after a week- too big, heavy, and awkward. was coming from a 7+, which imo feels much much better in the hand and is way lighter/easier to navigate. ended up getting into the regular 11 and feel much better with it. don't need the cameras. the battery life was nice, but the 11 is still much better than what i was used to. didn't notice a difference in the screens for my applications whatsoever.
an apple a day,kidney sold away,doctor on the way
I upgraded from a 6s. So a huge improvement for me. But curious about the next one. Will probably be worth the upgrade from this one if it supports 5G. Probably...
You can turn off the extended frame setting in the camera setting menu within setting app!!
Literally no point in upgrading
Watching this with my iphone 11 pro max😎
4k 120fps pleaseeee!!
will the price of this gets low next year?
The Verge: "We shot the most elaborate intro to an iPhone review."
The difference between Marques and all of the other you tubers that do phone reviews. Marques literally goes over every speck of the new phone. That’s what I like watching
Does it have esim?
Hahaha when you put phone that far ..of course you have to lean to see the screen also ..not just to unlock the phone
Im done with Apple 🤔So many androids out there not sure which one to get...Gotta watch some of your vids.
Can we discuss a newly added feature on that other phone called “Marques’s Fault”?
Still going with that notch gimmick for $1k lollll
Does anyone know where to find the wallpaper?
Any body having it. I want to buy
Even with my broken screen iphone 5s id rather upgrade my gtx1080 to a 2080 ti then upgrade my phone!
They should have made that apple logo on the back be a fingerprint scanner. Also, with these prices to start with the 64 gb for a storage, that is awfully shameful.
I want that wallpaper
Iphone 11 review pleaseeee
You missed Huawei in the night mode section.
Lookin like an Android Phone
Honestly, I would rather my iPhone XS have a bigger battery than 3D Touch.
Sht phone! Apple died with Steve Jobs!
How much does Apple Pay you to give this review?
@mkbhd xiaomi mi mix alpha
Marques! Can you please make a video for iphone 11 alone! Just want to understand how great it is compared to iphone xr...just a five minute one would work! Please please!!
That "Pro" in the name doesn't mean "Professional".
Well..... it’s official. I subscribed
Anyone else laughing at the camera design?
I like the 11 so Much
or if you have the jump plan at tmobile you can just grab this one and then grab the 2020 version next year..
I don't even want an iphone or maybe not even a new phone.. I'm good with my 3 year old smartphone.. 
I want ☝️
Still on the 6 baby. WOOOO!
368, what happened?
hi mkbhd i just want to ask what wallpaper are u using in your iphone 11on this review??
Waiting for Jerry's review on Apple saying "Toughest glass on any phone"
Awesome review.
what about Sony xperia 1 ? it does good pics. and videos !
wallpaper link?
OP 7T for an awesome phone camera? Lol yeah right. Samsung and Google’s cameras will sh!t on that one all day.
1.6million views in 9 hours 
Same old same old, couldnt they just change the design a bit, like remove the notch please Apple get with the program and justify your prices
Did they move the volume rocker to stop accidental screen shots at least 10 times a day 😂
Can you use portrait mode with pets and objects?
No innovation...!  Apple gone down!... One plus and Huawei rock!
1:53 "glass is glass" and it will break
Sooo basically... it's a great camera phone.
you mean its same design from last last year?
Am I the only one who noticed the difference in the brightness/display?
So iPhone 11 is more worth it than pro or pro Max?
"I want to turn setting OFF/ON"
Marques what is the wallpaper on your iphone plz send me
It is a ok review but I think that again... no much content , there are more features to shows. Other than that good quality video.
Does anyone have the wallpaper that Marques is using on the 11 Pro Max (red and blue one)?
iOS 13.1 will open up a few more pro features.
Even though I don't care for iphones I just LOVE watching a 
جربتو وماعجبني
My Samsung s9 was so good when I first bought it a year ago. But 2 months ago it started acting up and I only get 4 hours of screen time. I have tried everything to fix it but nothing works. I miss iOS and I really want the iPhone 11 pro, but I don't have that kind of money.
my iphone 6s is SO SLOW AND HAS AN ACTUALLY DEAD BATTERY LIFE
2:05 the fingerprints on the apple logo really irked me :p
Nothing new in terms of design, moderately upgraded, looks ugly.
Don't mind me I'm just here to see the 🐕 7:23
Iphone 11 review?
On the iPhone 11, its kinda difficult to swap between nightmode and flash. If i want a flash photo, it keeps buring the face.
An Apple a day keeps the Android away.
Please explain gigabit lte vs lte advanced "Gigabit LTE Explained!"
Ill upgrade when the notch is gone.
Looks like oppo and vivo phone 😆😂
Marques please please please do a review of the Huawei Mate 30 Pro
Please give me iPhone 11 pro. I am your big fan. Love you your YouTube channel. I am from Bangladesh.
"Glass is glass" 
Marq compare iphone xs vs iphone 11 pro 🙃
Imagin iphone 11 pro max having one plus 7 pro or samsung note series design......even apple would say oh my god.....
Link for the Wallpaper??
I look at apple I think about old phone
I'm not gonna lie, that intro was probably his best. That was mind boggling
+Marques, where'd you get the t-shirt in this video?
Hey Marques, don’t you have a Google Pixel 3 in your pocket? Lol.
We want the wallpaper homie.
Nice Tesla @ 7:50 !
All I heard in this video was “Nothing has changed but there are more colors and a new camera”
no mention of deep fusion at all
camera review @6:51
Wouldn't the 2020 iPhone be called 11s?
Can we notice any screen display difference between iPhone 11 and 11 pro ???
Who cares about the cameras? I have the XR and it already takes awesome pics.  The 3 cameras look silly too
Simpsons did it
Why u have ur dog in chains? Really?
just wait till iphone 12 ffs
3D Touch was the best feature and could have changed how interaction is on a phone. I’ll miss it
Should I switch from a S9 to a iPhone 11?
Glass is glass but we have bulletproof glass for cars. Make that light and bring it to phones.
🦹🏻‍♂️👍🏻
Remove all cameras but one high quality one in the back. Nobody uses their phone for that serious photography
Watching this from my iPhone 7 lol, i'm so far behind, yet works perfectly till this day
Damning by faint praise.  Apple needs to shake things up a bit.  It's getting pretty stale.
Mathew brownie I love these videos
Marques kindly let us know about the iphone 11 displays are getting easily scratched. Kindly confirm ur review on this matter on priority
camera is always #1 for me. lol
1:51 im not ganna test that!
My iphone Xr got  lost. :(  I don't know what to go for?
Inspired by MKBHD @
Why is that puppy posing so well? lol
what about the new hawawie met 30
Where did you get that wallpaper from ? Please share.
Who came here after getting bored with the unbox therapy Unboxings?
wait do you have a tesla??
I'll keep my pocophone f1...
I dont mind losing some of battery life i miss 3D Touch already
That Walpaper ??
So should we wait for iPhone 12?
The intro is great and all, but is it just me or is anyone else OCD’ed by the slight angle at which the iPhone is held at the beginning of the video?
Is it just me or 
Where is the link for wallpaper cuz it was fire
I'm brand new to iPhone, (trialing w/ 11 pro). I don't think it's ugly at all.  To me, camera lenses are camera lenses. You don't look at a high-end SLR camera and say, ew, look at the lens.  Cell cams have been chasing each other over the years and continually improving so, I'm not surprised to see 'em evolving like this at all.  I do like the mat finish very much!  I've no issues with the name/branding of the phone at all.  The jury is still out if I'll keep it.
will xs get the hold the camera button to turn into video? through update?
can you share the wallpaper from the video ???????
S11 all the way
My kidney is asking me to not watch this video🤣🤣
What wallpaper is that
what wallpaper is he using?
why didnt u said p30 pro the best at night captures?
I wish Android would have these exact Cameras in a Phone
I am gonna be random.
It's thanos for all iphone
1200 nits? had it since note 8.
Good intro style
This video should have been made in hdr
I'm happy with my iPhone X. It's good enough till the next year at the very least
The back is okay.  I love the color . But the notch is a no buy . Just make the bezel thin like sony xperia 5 .
MKHB explaining why expensive high end phones just aren't worth upgrading anymore because the improvements are so relatively small. He has convinced me lower end models get the more bang for the buck.
what’s your advice Silver or space grey ??
Would you take this over the OnePlus 7pro?
nice review man.thumbs up!!
No one does reviews better then MKBHD! ✌️
Please compare 11 pro max with 7t pro mclaren edition. Please please and please 😌
Great review likewise 😊😊
Nah I need an upgrade from iphone 6s to 11pro
No 5G!
Why android users are always curious about iPhone?
Do not buy it yet, Next year they will have 6 cameras. I am sure it breaks like sugar glass as all of them :)
fidget spinner cameras
Did i just hear Casey Niestat's 388's Intro music in this video's intro!?
Did anyone hear the beep in the video??
pixel 4 or this?
Go buy a rog phone 2
Pls share Wall Paper link shown in video at 2.30
He's probably had the pixel 4 for a couple of months now
my dream phone 1 like 1 pray i get it
its crazy how expensive it is and iphone 12 is going to be more expensive can only buy used ones now
Hi Marques , Wallpaper is nice.
Oneplus 7 pro vs iPhone 11 pro please
Where can i get that wallpaper?
Sooo...Whats new again.? S10+ user
Hi Marques Brownlee,
Big hmm on the facial hair
You missed the opportunity to say “glass is glass, and glass can break”😑
The bezels are slightly thicker this year.
so how do you do take the quick photos? you know the feature where you hold the shutter button and it takes hundreds of pictures and you choose what one looks best? how do we do that on the iphone 11? because im getting that on tuesday next week and i use my camera alot
From your personal use, which display is better. One plus 7 Pro or iPhone 11 Pro
No watch 5 review?
Personally I’m gonna stick with my iPhone XS Max this year. My battery is still great and I don’t take a lot of pics which is a big selling point so yeah
wallpaper link?
dat intro doe
Is it worth an upgrade from iPhone X?
Does this model have twin sim card slots?
i don't care about phones....
The camera bump is made to look like the old TV cameras with triple rotating lenses
can you review Samsung Tab?
MKBHD has a crush on suprapixel
Broo I am sibin from India ...taken a new iPhone 11 on 22 sep and I did a under water video shoot on sep 27th and one of my speaker on the top not working correctly some murmur sounds ..any solution for this...?
When you love apple but you know deep inside you there’s still android running inside you. 🤣🤣🤣 so me
Is it worth paying double the price of the XR? I might just get the XR since its so much cheaper.. Coming from a 6 I've had since 2015
Why he keep saying pro? I thought it is the pro max? My country has got 11, 11 pro and also 11 pro max hmm
Did you completely skip over the 2x camera lens?? as I'm trying to decide if I should get the Pro or 11, and the main difference is the 2x lens. Thoughts? Did I just miss it in your video?
So are we not going to mention that Apple does not how to count?
Whichever phones you have ,u ll end up editing photos before posting on instagram 🤔
Plz mi mixalpha review
Im so over apple.
iPhone 11 vs xr?
It’s super ugly, those 3 camera looks like a monster🥴
Should try watching GOT "The Long Night" in this phone to see how bright the display
whats that wallpaper  mkbhd !😐
Marques looks like an English premiere league player
Wow, I’ll only have this phone in my wildest dreams 😓
iOS is 13.1 is out now! At least on my iPad 13.1 is what I’m on now!
I always loved Marques unbiased reviews on phones. I feel complete with this review and I don't need to watch any other videos about the 11 Pro.
Casey Neistat's Intro  Song!
When is smartphone of the year awards 2019 video coming out
Wall paper link ?
4 cameras.
Me: I want an option to....
i love iphone
Why nobody is talking about intro transitions
Bruh I did not know that spacebar trick..
Op7 pro vs 10 s max
It’s gonna be so hard to hold back till next year 😪
One can buy a note 10 and a dslr at the same amount.
Do I get the iPhone 11 or iPhone 11 Pro?
3D touch on iphone x/xs is 3 times faster then iphone 11 pro haptic touch, apple is going backwards ... don't belive it ? ...compare it!
Please marques could you publish your wallpaper or share a link where to find that amazing picture!!! Thanks
Ios 13.1 fixes night mode problems at least for me it did
Review redmi note 8 pro
Whats the point of this phone? Camera?
5:23 just a candy store chilling  in the background.
How is Marques not signed away to a big network already?!? These reviews are WAY better than anything you find on the "news".
Is 64GB enough for normal use?
Did you delete some of your resent videos?
still no INNOVATION
You defended it well, but still in vain
when that intro music brings back 368 memories...
Awesome video please watch my new video 😆🙏❤️
Which one is better iphone 11 or the XS? if upgrading from iphone 7
iPhone 11 series is hard evidence of a perpetual 'jobs' vacancy...
The 3-eyed camera on the back is just creepy looking - very alien like, and I turn away everytime I see it.
dude, the intro itself is worth a million dollars. totally appreciate your effort
seriously? For the record, yes the face unlock camera must see your face to unlock the phone
You my iphone 6s? Gee thanks. Just got it.
People: The phone looks ugly with 3 cameras! They should get rid of it!
Not moving from my iPhone 8 until we see the return of Touch ID
what do you think about upgrading from samsum galaxy j2 to an iphon 11 pro it sounds good right😂😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😆😆😆 hell yeah😇
Most dramatic intro of his videos
Fantastic intro
Do you use your phone daily without case?
Can't wait for the jailbreak to make popcorn on those eyes
I would prefer a thicker phone with 3D Touch than a thinner phone without it!
Hahaha iPhone 11 Pro camera's looks like a KITCHEN HOB😆😄😃😀😂 looks ugly and NOT that attractive👎👎👎
People actually bought this
Apple has lost its innovative edge
Ehh they all the same to me
After your Note 10 plus review I figured you'd really point out the lack of 90mhz fluid display and how you're used to it with OnePlus, iPad. You know, it's one of your favorite features and all.
Yep, I wasn’t one of those people sayin it looked ugly when we saw renders, and now that we have it in hand, everyone that said it was is in aw, and broke.
Nice montage
Marques wants lasers coming out of your eyes to unlock the iphone...good luck telling God that
Apple add ultrawide=innovation
Has anyone noticed that suddently video quality on preivous iphone has gone down. such as iphone 6s, iphone 7 and iphone xs. I have 2 and 3 years old video which looks awesome while now when i shoot video from iphone xs max, they look out of focus and shaky even at 1080 60fps. is it something apple did to make iphone 11 stand out?
The only iPhone review to be viewed.
Me watching on my s10+ : oh good for them they finally know some.. things.. still has that ugly notch but.. yeah.
Let the Pixel 4 come out then I'll decide if I wanna buy this one or not.
RIP IPHONE
New iPhone has WiFi 6? Looks like you need some wireless access points to match. Check out Cisco Meraki.
What about the pro max?
Still no headphone jack?
Finally a phone with fidget spinner.
Intro=Neistat=368
If it's a bit further away from you and still unlocks ... are you sure? Does apple want you to look directly into it for it to be unlocked?? Touch ID is coming back btw :p
Hy marques plz review the Huawei mate 30 pro
Hi guys. I'm experiencing some strange behavior of my iphoneX updated to the newest IOS13. When I try to call some people using Siri she finds the contact, but keeps on saying that i have to choos a number, even when there is only one number saved, or even when I tell her which number to choose and call (mobile, home, ...). Somebody with the same prob or an idea how to solve this?????? Thanx folks
Since when did Marques start growing a neck beard? Man, I’ve been gone a long time.
Hi Marcus, which camera is better Pixel 3 or Iphone 11 Pro???
Do a camera comparison with the pixel 4, iPhone pro max and note 10!! Please phone master?
nice intro
Good to know to not update from phone 7 to 11 as not much improved. I wish they at list made the corps look like on iPad pro. That will be the best looking iPhone like 5 was. When you will do gopro8 black review?
I thought he rubbed the apple logo off lmaoo I’m so dumb 1:17
Where's the apple watch video
Innovation kha hai?
There's no way to manually turn on night mode?
Curious question - My friend is a firm believer that through every major iOS upgrade, say 11 to 12, it lowers the quality of the photos but there doesn't seem to be any logic/proofs behind her claim. She's now telling me that I'll start noticing the decline in the quality of my photos once I get to iOS 14. Anyone else noticed or feel the same?
Wallpaper link ?? @mkbhd
Nice 👌
Can't afford it but nothing wrong with looking at and appreciating it. The matte looks gorgeous.
can i have your wallpaper ?
Along with Iphone 11, we can also witness the design for the next Redmi note series model 😂
This ... unlocking at an angle thing is a bad idea. I get why he would like to use it but its...a huge security risk.
IMAGINE  IF YOU WALK IN A ROOM AND THEN YOUR PHONE STARTS CHARGING O.O
Soon enough phones will be cinematic cameras with the capability of texting and calling.
Same intro music as @368
Intro music reminded me of casey neistat 368 intro 🤣
Well don’t you think that 90hz is enough for mobile devices? 120hz on iPhone 12...I just simply don’t want the battery life same as the X
I don’t like camera, like color
such a pain that people have to spend 3 thousand dollars from the original X just to get these incremental upgrades  and to consider the design is still the same. apple for me is just pure greed to its finest form.
Other then the night mode what camera improvements will truly matter to the average consumer who is just taking life and family moments.
6:40 Now that's what you call a tech reviewer!
Cheese grater? Stove top? Somebody needs to feed the developers at apple.
The only issue with this phone is that NOTCH
