Looks a little like Ned, has Zach’s energy, Keith’s appetite, and Eugene’s personality. The Try Guys need to adopt him.
Me: I hate kids
Eugene: I don’t like kids 
why tf is the kid actually entertaining and seems like he knows what hes doing
this kids use of words... it’s crazy. like I didn’t really use the word “iconic” until i was like 15 or 16... 
Eugene isn’t doing a good job of pretending he doesn’t like kids
Next time Ned is sick you can call this kid in and no one would notice.
So, am I the only one who remembers  apple jacks having a mascott? Like he was a cinnimon stick dude.
This kid has better commentary than most celebrities
Eugene being legit friends with a human child is the best character development in the history of the world.
Eugene: I hate kids. 
this kid's sense of humor is better than most comedians'
Jamie: "I took a bite of life and now i wanna spit it out."
This kid is way funnier than I ever was at his age, and is more funnier than I'll ever be.
jamie: "i dont think you're pulling your weight"
How did Jamie's parents raise such a positive and well spoken child?
“what’s the tag line?”
"Ever heard of the Flintstones?"
Why is Jamie cooler than I’ll ever be
Next on wattpad: "Adopted by the Try Guys. Chapter One: hi! My name is Jamie!"
This child has a larger vocabulary then most adults
“there’s no mascot for apple jacks” the Cinna-Mon erasure jumped out
I'm not a kids person. Like at all. But this kid is adorable and I love him.
"Yeah I dont think you're pulling your weight."
"let's put the milk in first" 
This kid has better commentary than most celebrities
This kid is way funnier and mature than most teenagers I know
Why does Jamie seem like when he gets to Middle School he’s gonna be the popular gay queen everyone loves? Like this isn’t meant to be offensive, it’s just something I can see
Fruit Loops are basically rainbow cheerios. They are now call "Queer"ios.
This child is the living embodiment of all the fans together.
Eugene being legit friends with a human child is the best character development in the history of the world.
Jamie: "You don't just get cereal, you get some therapy!"
Alternative title: Eugene eats cereal with his son
“Here comes the nostalgia train. Choo choo!”
Lucky Charms slids down the ranking
Eugene went from “I hate kids” to “Maybe I’m right maybe I’m wrong let all get along” to “Can I adopt you”
this kid is so goshdarn funny. genuinly, he has the fastest wit ive ever seen
That isn't a kid! That is just Eugene in a small version!
“Maybe I should just go home and chug a class of corn.” 
As much as Eugene says he doesn’t like kids, he’s so cute with them!
jamie has more personality than everyone at my highschool combined.
WHY DOES THIS KID MAKE ME THINK OF YOUNG SHELDON
“ Maybe I should just go home, and chug a glass of corn”..... I love this kid lol.
When he said “it doesn’t appeal to my 11 year old mouth” I didn’t feel as old because of all of the vocab he was using I’m 12 so yeah
Me: Why do I literally agree with every single thing Eugene says?
Miles' enthusiasm for losing his job is just everything.
I didn’t realize how many cereals I’ve tried before until now 😂
Jamie is so funny and articulate, especially for the age of 11.
I hoor we’re gonna see more of this kid, he’s adorable
Why is this Ned’s kid in 12 years😂
I think Eugene doesn’t like the responsibility of raising a kid, but he likes kids that’s not his
Not to be dramatic or anything but I’d die for Jamie
We like Jamie, bring him back in the future.
no one: 
I’m kind of disappointed that Krave wasn’t on here😞
This child is either going to be an actor, a tv host, or president
I was expecting this to be rubbish but that kid is hilarious.
He's calling all the cereals that just enjoyed as a child "old people cereal." I guess I just had an old soul.
So I tried “I’m right, you’re wrong, shut up” on my wife last week. Swelling went down just enough so I could type this.
“i took a bite out of life and i want to spit it out” is going to be my senior quote
PETITION FOR TRY GUYS TO TRY TO IKEA FURNITURE WITHOUT INSTRUCTIONS WHILE DRUNK
Eugene - Rank King. 
jamie: the person we never knew we needed, but greatly appreciate
The tagline of Wheaties: “Russell Wilson”
This is the cutest little boy I’ve ever seen
Who coached this kid and when is his comedy special coming out on Netflix
We need Jamie back. Actually, let’s give him a show. 😂😂
I just watched Eugene and a child eat for over half an hour and loved every minute
Eugene : I don't like kids  
“I don’t think you’re pulling your weight.” 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂💀💀
Jamie: anything 
I hope he doesn't get into social media. Ruins everyone.
I love Eugene's ranking.  Hes right, you're wrong.
The Fifth Try Guy Right guy for sure.
Can you make like a "Eugene Dresses The Other Try Guys For A Week"
Waffle Crisp, come on guys lets be professionals here.
Cows: i feel like when you wake up you don’t want to eat corn
He is defs future Wes 😂 looks like Ned have characteristics of the rest, with those uncles I don't see him to turn out any other way
WE NEED JAMIE TO COME BACK AGAINNNN
WHEN HE ATE THE RAISIN BRAN 💀🤣 “grandma whataya doin????”
American cereal names kind of lack something... frosted flakes just doesn’t have the same ring to it as frosties
That child is soooo cute !
me, watching this with my friend: he's literally adorable
Eugene: I don’t like kids and kids don’t like me
Forget about the cereal, I’m appalled by the fact that Jamie didn’t know who the Flinstones were
“You know, I don’t think you’re pulling your weight.” 😂😂
two things. This child gives me life. and Honey bunches of oats is the best cereal.
My most favorite cereals in order:
Eugene: I DONT LIKE KIDS
i don’t like children.. but i’m obsessed with this child.  Have him in every video please.
This kid confirms I have never been, nor ever will be as cool or witty as him
What about Chucky Charms
Who else was rooting 👀 for cinnamon toast crunch 😋
Eugene says he doesn’t like kids but he’s so good with them
AM I INSANE OR DID THERE USED TO BE AN APPLE JACKS MASCOT
Jamie is smarter and funnier than I'll ever be in my grown years, help
Jaimie is my new favorite try guy
Alternative Title: The Try Guys Adopt a Child
Why is this kid so cultured and smart whoever raised him did such a good job
Eugene has to try the French toast cinnamon toast crunch if he was baffled by the shapes of the regular one XD
I love Jamie so much he’s so intelligent and interesting I need more ASAP
We want more jamie it’s official. Give this kid his own mini series on here 😂
JAMIE IS ICONIC AND I LOVE HIM. Jamie the internet loves you <3
this kid is just all the try guys in one
this kid is so cute and well spoken
3:45 "I dont think I'll ever understand the reasoning"
I love this kid and I agree with Eugene 99% (Raisin brand shouldn’t exist 🤢)
jamie was a great edition. would love for him to be an honorary member
Why is this kid such an intellectual like he's def smarter than me and his sass is so amazing
YALL NEED TO HIRE JAMIE OR AT LEAST GIVE HIM HIS OWN SERIES!!😂😂❤️
when you realize that you just watched half an hour of a kid and a gay guy eating a bunch of cereal you love :)
Is it just me or this kid is going to gay in the future
Who is this kid and why don't I have him as a kid brother?!?!
Eugene only likes this kid because he’s exactly like Eugene
"Wheaties!" "RUSSEL WILSON"
I'm SO ANXIOUS cause there's no table and everything's on the floor.
Favorites are-
"you are so fancy~" 
Eugene: I don't like kids
Cinnamon toast crunch is the best cereal ever!!!
I want all the try guys to play twister together!
I think Eugene becoming a big ol' softie is one of the greatest things I've ever seen on the internet
I love Jamie with every fiber of my being. He is a pure joy with an amazing personality. Jamie speaks so intelligently and witty, that’s hard to find in an 11 year old. He should definitely make his own Youtube channel and he would dominate everyone else on this platform.
Eugene; I hate children
13:30 my mind: i got a taste of life and already want to die
Have they never had cereal before🤦🏻‍♀️
Whenever Jamie places the boxes backwards I cringe
cinnamon toast bit
Jamie literally goes to my school I love him
This kid is so smart. He's going places.
I'm offended there was no Oreo O's
Eugene : I'm right, you're wrong, shut up
that kid is so powerful he made Eugene want to ADOPT him......
“I don’t think you’re pulling your weight.”    Me: spits out my pumpkin pie.
where are the KoKo Krunch and Oreo Os? :(
This was just a ploy by Jamie's mom to figure out what cereals he likes XD
Tell me I wasn’t the only one who saw all might when they said ultra flakes ? 😁
Wes           Jamie 
I can't believe Jamie knows (and used!) the word 'umbrage'.... he's eleven
Eugene just subtly readjusting every box Jamie puts down Lool
26:50 - Alexandria almost murdering a child
I feel personally attacked that Golden Grahams cereal was not included in the taste testing.
Miles: exists 
I love jamie 😂😂 such a hilarious and well spoken kid
I'd be so happy if Jamie was the 5th try guy
I haven't tasted any of these though. :--(
theater kids creep me out.
Eugene: I hate kids
Eugene: I'm not a huge peanut butter person
I was one of those weird kids who actually liked Raisin Bran. Still do. Reese's Puffs are my number one, though. 
If Cinnamon Toast Crunch isn’t ranked first I’m leaving
I cannot believe this child said “I take umbrage with their lie” at 18:02 like wtf I literally had to look up what that meant
The King found his heir
Yes! Cinnamon toast crunch is my absolute fav
I feel like this is how Wes will be when he gets older.
He looks like a mini Ned
When I was this kid’s age, I could hardly complete a well-thought-out sentence by mouth. This kid could talk circles around me... even now!
The next Try Guys episode: Eugene Trys  To Adopt Jamie
Omg his “yea” is so cute
I saw this kid and I was like huh Ned’s kid aged up real fast.
lmao, is that Aaron Paul in the corn pops commercial or am i having a stroke?
jaime is so great he needs to come back. MAKE JAIMES RE APPEARANCE A THING PLEASE HE'S A ENTERTAINMENT GENIUS!!!!!!!!
wish I had this kid's confidence back when I was 11 like damnnnn
"You know, I don't think you're pulling your weight"
Dude Jamie(when he is a bit older ofc)would be amazing as a youtuber. Or even just someone involved with media or infulencing people. Like wow lol
He looks like Clairo for some reason
Me before the video even starts: Cinnamon Toast Crunch is the best..
"Maybe I should just go home and chug some corn,"
Then there’s me with my gluten intolerance 😂
tfw that kid might as well not know about 80% what they say cuz of age
People call me crazy for not liking milk with my cereal.
Eugene: LOOK AT ALL DOSE NUTS 
“I’ve been watching the Try Guys for three years now”
This child is the best child
Jamie is a little firecracker. I love his energy.
Id cancel plans with my friends to hang out with him instead
The sounds a of the spoon on the glass makes me want to die
Eugene: I don't like kids
Cinnamon Toast Crunch, you introduced us to vore as small children.
his Ned impersonation 😭
Ok you really needed to get honey bunches of oats with STRAWBERRIES
Jamie is amazing loool his impressions are * chefs kiss *
Jamie: “I don’t think you’re pulling your weight”
Please have Jamie in more videos.... “The Try Guys Juniors”🤔
Anyone else realise that on GMM they ranked Cinnamon Toast Crunch as the top as well
28:55
Eugene breaking Jamie’s brain with lucky charms and raisin brand rankings XD
did this kid just suggest a collab with the try guys and Shane dawson? 
Eugene has rank king , Keith has eating the menu, Zach has candid competition , its time Ned gets an individual series.
Jamie is probably my favorite child ever...the cutest absolute cutest
I didn't think there's a person more savage than Eugene's mom.
I love this child
Eugene with every child: I cannot train him
Jamie has ruined the careers of all the language arts, English, and reading teachers out there
you guys should totally try korean:s oreo cereal, it:s AMAZING
28:56 Who's editing? I love you.
Ever since I was a kid 
Eugene: i hate kids
I laughed every time Eugene fixed the way the cereal was facing
i adore jamie so much, he needs to come back 😭
I cheered way to hard at Eugene’s number one ranking this time, that is my favorite cereal
Raisin bran has been my favorite cereal since I was really little. I still love it lol
This child talks way more sophisticated than I ever could.
this is legit one of the funniest Try Guys episodes ever! MUST feature this kid more often, he’s a true delight! also my favorite rendition of Eugene ever.
I’ve never enjoyed listening to a child’s commentary more in my life lol
I feel like if Eugene raised a kid they would turn out exactly like Jamie. Like 💯 just like Jamie
8:54
“I took a bite out of life, and I wanted to spit it out.” - Jamie 2k19
25:57
Not hating on the child infact I thought he was pretty good at the commentary although his voice really did get on my nerves. Not trying to hate but yeah.
When Eugene said "ultra flakes" and they put in a picture of All Might this makes me happy
32:37 "Tucan sam, gay icon what can I say" 😂 yas!
“I took a bite out of life, and I wanted to spit it out”
Love the ""Gladiator" bit at the beginning!
Jamie’s mom make sure he makes his own you tube account
Literally just watched this whole video to see if Eugene was correct, and he was. Cinnamon Toast Crunch is the undisputed best cereal.
Fun Fact: I once cracked my tooth eating Raisin Bran.
"milk first? or..."
MY GOSH HOW I MISSED THOSE COOKIE CRISPS CEREAL 😭😭❤
Eugene literally picked my two favorites for one and two. I’m so beyond proud :,)
Please like this so they see it. So can you guys do Eugene ranks every Starbucks drink
Any other UK fans find it funny that they call him a rank kid
This video should be called “Eugene Learns that He Actually Likes Kids”. Nah, scratch it. It’s too long.
Lol damn there's really no female cereal mascots
make more vids with this child
Am I the only one who actually likes soggy Fruity Pebbles?
I’m pretty sure that Jamie is Eugene’s son😂
Eugene: I hate kids
Jamie is so far my favorite kid from Rank King. Oh wow, I just got the pun. Some of you might know that, but I bet I blew a mind out there right now, 🤯
eugene wanted to put the milk in first
When you're an adult and you like raisin brand and mini wheats the most 😔😔😔
33:15 I KNEW IT. He’s a Capricorn AND in love with Cinnamon Toast Crunch. Subscribed. Just look at the poor kids face trying to come to terms with the truth 🤣🤣🤣😂😂😌🔥
Eugene: I don't like kids
Oh my god it’s a tiny Eugene. 😂😂 this kid is so savage. I love it.
the kid reminds me of young sheldon.... specially the way he speaks. i love him!
Eugene has almost the perfect list. 
"i took a bite out of life and i wanted to spit it out" lmao
Eugene: I don't like kids
I LOVE HIM SO MUCH HOLY MY COW
30:28 Lmao Eugene acted like such a mother!!!
This kid is gonna go far in life lol
Jamie is the best!!! Bring Jamie back in the future!!! In 20 years, the Try Guys/Girls will consist of: Wes, Jamie (Who can act as Eugene's kid since Eugene "HaTeS kIdS"), Keith's future kid, and Zach's future kid
eugene hating kids to literally asking to adopt a child is true character development
28:56
i love jamie more than i love myself.
How old am I?!? Jamie didn’t know the Flintstones or the trix rabbit! They were my childhood!
Awesome according  to Eugene my favorite  cereal is #1🤗
Oh my god a child on camera who is hilarious and not annoying in the slightest. I shall adopt him.
Pops? THEYRE CALLED CORN POPS
Raisin Bran is SO good i been love it since I was a kid omg
I love cearal but since I got older I can't have the sugar ones first thing because it makes me sick. I switched to healthy cearal now for breakfast and stuff like froot loops for snacks
Jamie: You might need to pour me a lot 
“Both Jewish and probably losing our hair” Jaimie 2019
This whole time I've been thinking is a little kid but it turns out he's the same age as me..😂
i dont think ive ever loved a child more in my life
Jamie is so adorable.
i need to say it, lucky charms are THE most overrated cereal that exists
"Apple Jacks don't have a mascot."
I have you know, I’m only 23 and my favorite cereal is raisin brand 😂
When the kid tells you to like and comment... you like and comment! 
So many great one liners this episode!!! 🤣😅 Gotta love Jamie!! 🥰
28:56 OMG THE BNHA REFERENCE!! Props to whichever editor did this <3
Jamie: Exists
6:33 I screamed cause I really want that to happen :D
Jamie's so funny!!! I love it! Him and Eugene have such good dynamic!
i hate precocious kids, but this one is a genius, no joke. who talks like that at this age...so eloquent!
The second the kid said "Gossip" I turned this off.
This is the least annoying child I've ever seen trying to do comedy
bestdressed approved cereal ranking
this kid is legendary
Also Kellogg's Honey and almond was my favorite in highschool 😜
Little did you know Captain crunch is not a captain he’s a Commander
“You don’t just get cereal you get therapy” -Jamie 2019
Eugene's ranking was pretty much my ranking, cinnamon toast crunch is a m a z i n g I swear
Eugene's character growth on his feelings about children warm my heart <3 <3 <3
I think he’s a great example of how watching the right kind of humorous content gives him a more mature sense of humour to be that quick witted, interesting seeing the positive influence of YouTube in the personalities of younger kids when all you hear about is how it’s corrupting them..
There was absolutely no awkwardness and I mclove it.
Eugene: I don’t usually like kids
Jamie is adorable-we love him
Next video: Eugene ranks the try guys
I love those kid so much omg he’s so funny
This kid need a talk-show 😂
“You don’t just get cereal you also get therapy” ashaskjdhsskjdhsjkfsjk howis this kid this amazing at such a young age
I LOVE THIS KID
I want to eat like 20 bowls of cereal now
MILES IN THE BACK THO KAJSHFAHS this is why we love him
I miss the old HoneyCombs taste. Rip to my favorite cereal :(
Okay but for the one who says he doesn’t like kids he is THE best with kids
Eugene's ranking is wrong, Jamie's ranking is right, shut up
Is that a my hero acadamia refrence
Honey bunches is my childhood
I loe this kid! He is Eugene's twin
"How do I adopt you?"
Jamie is my favorite honorary Try Guy ever
I love mini wheats 😭
ive never had a lot of these cereals but i already know my favorites are cheerios, corn flakes and special k because I don't really like sweet food
My favorites are literally all of the ones on the right side, and my husband’s are all the ones on the left side xD
“Oooh, child, welcome to adulthood.” 
I freaking love Jaime x) he's just amazingly funny and smart, what a way to go young man!
apple jacks does have a mascot it has the cinimon stick and the apple guy or am I just making things up
13:44 me waking up every day
Who bought the cereal for this video? Peanut Butter Crunch and Coco Pebbles are the best cereals, and neither are represented!
Raisin Bran:
Eugene should adopt all the kids and rank them lol
I dont generally like kids but this kid is funny, loved the episode
Omg this kid is the cutesttttt 😭 I love himmmmmm hahahah
Was that Aaron Paul in that POPS commercial?? lol
This child is wise and cultured beyond his years
How did they find this perfect child?
Fact: enjoying Raisin Bran can bring upon a midlife crisis
Jamie, if you see this, you’re so amazing, please don’t stop being you
I've always liked raisin bran haha, even as a kid. you guys are making me crave cereal now
“I Have cereal when I wanna have cereal”  - Jamie 2019 
wheaties are my favorite cereal :c
did nobody notice that he doesn’t know what the flinstones are
28:49 The look on my face when I realized I have to leave my dogs.
I freakin' LOVE raisin bran.
Not going to lie: seeing Eugene with Jamie is absolutely the CUTEST thing I have ever seen. This video just made my morning and my entire day! Jamie and Eugene should have their own little segment in every video!
That's Jessie Pinkman in the Pops advert
I audibly cheered when he put Cinnamon Toast Crunch first 😂 Also Jamie is wonderful, have him in more videos!
wait... They’re just called Pops?? I’ve never called them just Pops i’ve only called them Corn Pops...
This kid says yeah too much
Eugene: “tHe sOgGaBiLiTy”
This kid is so iconic XD Try Guys who, we need Jamie :P
I’m so excited! Cinnamon Toast Crunch is my fav cereal!
can i laugh when i was 5 i loved raisin bran 😂
My favorite cereal of all time is Cookie Crisps. How dare they
Conspiracy theory: Jamie is just the child of all the try guys. There’s no mom, its just Ned in a dress off camera. THINK ABOUT IT
Eugene seems so happy now 🥰🥰
I feel you eugene...i like one kid exactly on this planet and that's my baby brother.. Other kids just suck.
I remember watching Cocoa Puffs commercials when I was younger and when I rewatch it now I realized he was on crack or lsd 😂
stop hating on raison bran, raison bran is amazing
Eugene: Should we put the milk in... first?
"Like the daily tea"
5:20 how does this kid even know what the 1980's are like.... I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE 1980'S ARE LIKE!!!
I love Jamie! I'd love to see more of the Rank Kid :)
Eugene is so good with kids!
eugene: i don't like kids
I’m offended by his treatment of honey bunches of oats 😂 my parents only bought healthier stuff and it was my savior cereal
Where is Oreo O's in the ranking???
That kid is wearing Bob Ross socks.
Waiting for the day Wes is a guest judge 😂
Okay, but this kid is making Eugene laugh. Hire him. Now.
I love that this kid knows words like ‘notion’ and ‘nostalgic’. Better than my high schoolers.
I realllllly hope they do more videos with Jamie. This was so pure and wholesome I loved this video. What a smart, kind, well spoken kid 🥺
I don't like cereal, but I like Eugene...soooooooo 🤷‍♀️
The whole video was pretty much Eugene having proud dad moments lol
that kid understands life
our lord and savior All Might blessed us for a moment 🙏🏻
Ok I need more of Jamie please!! What a smart kid.
Makes you wonder why so many foods were invented by people trying to avoid masturbating.
8:09
Literally Jamie is the child version of Eugene. Straight Up
Rice krispies come on the screen 
Thank you for the My Hero Academia reference! That made my day!
i must be gettin' old cause my rank is exactly the same as eugene's
Jamie was an amazing guest, Thank you for being so entertaining
Eugene: I hate kids.
this is so wholesome, why do i want Eugene as my dad lol
4:41 He really knows what he's talking about you also put the cereal in first the internet would have gone crazy. I am very shocked a bit offend that Eugene would suggest to put the milk in first
This child got a lead role in public theatre and it went straight to his head; and by God let it stay there he's brilliant!
29:24 I was about to flip out if they were not on there XD... Yes, i hit you with that "XD"
"Jack Douglass tried to do that."
Eugene: "cinnamon.... twig" . Pretty sure it's a cinnamon STICK, but it's fine ;)
It was amazing Jamie be my best friend please!!!
I wish I was like that kid when I was younger
Jamie knows more words than I do
Jamie is 11 years old and already way cooler than I'll ever be
im so happy that my personal top 10 is similar to eugene's
Is this how kids are nowadays?? Gee, they are more mature than my generation
That cinematic intro reminded me The Gladiator movie 😏
I love this kid he’s so good
kids Eugene Likes:
I miss the other try guys 🥺
Eugene! I was watching Brooklyn nine nine and I hade no clue you made a quest appearance in season 6! Great for you!
Love that you threw All Might in there
Omg I love this Kid haha bye miles lol 😂😂
Why is Jamie so cool??? Like????? I wasn’t that cool ever
I bought some healthier cereal and I'm totally regretting it rn
Jamie is hilarious and adorable xD!
Somomamitch I just realized... Rank King... Ranking... sumumamitch 🙄
I need this child to be my friend. He is so fetch!
I like that Eugene talks to kids like they’re real people.
I thought it was funny how Jamie loved the box backwards and Eugene had to fix it every time!
WHAT HONEY BUNCHES OF OATS ARE DELICIOUS. I'M A CHILD AND I LOVE IT
I freaking love this kid!!!!!
Is anyone else bothered from the fruit loops? I just can’t
Eugene: I hate kids
I skipped the whole video just to see Cinnamon Toast Crunch wasn’t 1st😭
Agreed.  CINNAMON TOAST CRUNCH IS THE BEST
Jamie, you’re so smart and witty for your age. I hope you go places, lil dude. 👊🏼
This child is brilliant, he even knows about cannibalism.
Tuscan Sam is the Michael Scott of cereal sales 😂😂
In Canada “pops” are corn pops
Needed Golden Grams and French Toast Crunch in there smh 🍞🥣🥛
Lmao the ending. The next vid they posted was an Eat the Menu😂👌
Jamie: "And if you don't agree: I'm right, you're wrong, shut up.",
I used to love trix yogurt so much and I forgot about honeycomb but now I remember the commercials, reminds me of my childhood
This was awesome! Plus the chemistry of these two playing off each other was so great! Eugene being so confused when he wants to adopt this child is hilarious!
Y'all are delusional: Kix and Life are the best cereals!
i sincerely hope the child doesnt listen to the podcast where they literally talk about docking in ep. 1
Eugene: I've only had Jamie for a day and a half but if anything happens to him i'll kill everyone in this room then myself.
Bro why is this kid like the perfect representation of Eugene when he was a kid?? I swear they act the same
This kid is Eugene's mini-me. Love this episode
I might love this kid more than my own!
omg i love jaime put him in more vids and adopt him
Me as soon I hit my 20’s: “I took a bite out of life and I wanted to spit it out” 
Should have had rice crispy treats instead of the classic
My favorite cereal:
Can he please rank the "All Together" cereal from Kellogg?
Can we talk about how Eugene readjusted the cereal boxes every time they weren’t facing a certain way 😂
When Jamie entered the room I thought he would be annoying. I was wrong, he's quite articulated and seems natural at this
Cini Mini’s for the win
No hate or disrespect but... Has Eugenes face gotten bigger?
Please get the kid back for more shows, he’s great!
someone lmk why the music at one point is the desert from dancing line😂😂
Jamie: I dont think you're pulling your weight 
Who cares if the packaging is cute that kid is adorable 🤣
Life isn't just a disappointing cereal Jamie.....
Who's the guy in the background at 1:32 though? 🔥
BLESS MY FAVORITE CEREAL IS #1
Eugene when talked about Apple Jacks- “there’s no mascot”
He’s not really a captain
This is my new favorite video
28:56 ULTRA FLAKES (with All Might!!!)
i just started watching you guys about a week ago thanks to my friend 😎
Eugene: milk first?
Honey smacks certainly got snubbed! Also figured frosted cherries be there.
Eugene's OCD on full display as he keeps turning the cereal boxes so that they're all facing the same way. :)
I love this kid so much oh my god
GET THIS KID A SHOW😂😂
"I took a bite out of life and I wanna spit it out." - Jamie 2019
Loved the kids attitude🤣🤣🤣 also I TOTALLY agree with Eugene’s list like Cinnamon Toast Crunch 😍❤️👏👏👏
Love Jamie! He's great! As for my favorite cereal, it's choco puffs. I never had it as a kid, but it's become my naughty treat as an adult.  Though as for cereal I might actually eat in the morning/as a meal, any muesli with fruits. (I love dried strawberries!) However, I have it with yoghurt, not milk. Muesli goes better with yoghurt and it's more of a filling meal.
Im 11 🖐 and i LOVE LOVE honey bunches of oats 👍👍👍👍❤❤
28:55 ALL MIGHT
Fact: Eugene would make a great dad. That's it. That's the comment.
Eugene I love you but I've never wanted to strangle you more than when you put Fruity Pebbles so close to the bottom
3:08 ... yes be do agree
This kid is amazing 💯
I never heard of wheaties
Jamie is my new favorite
The laugh at 19:37 just gave me pure joy.
Sometimes I question my life
WHEN THE TRY GUYS ARE COMING TO SEATTLE BUT YOU CAN’T EVEN GO WTDIFHCICHO
“I took a bite out of life and i wanted to spit it out” this kid is my favorite honestly like Eugene did you give him a script or did you just have a jewish son that you didnt tell us about??? 😂😂😂😂
Yaaasss!! My mom never let me have sugary cereals, so when I would go visit my grandma during the summers, I got to have them, and Cinnamon Toast Crunch (the taste you can see!) and Pops were my favourites. Good job, Eugene!
Shouldve judged it on the milk taste - how it affects the milk after its been sitting in the milk
HE’S ADORABLE
I guess I still have child taste buds because I agreed with Jamie’s ranking more than Eugene’s
Why is this 11 year child smarter than me, he pulled up with the word umbrage, and I had no idea what tf that meant
I feel you, Eugene, I never liked Lucky Charms either.
Raisin Brand has always been my favorite and it always will be
I like.. squeaked when I saw all might there 😂
milk. first. that's the way to go.
Ever since Eugene has come out as gay, he just radiates with happiness and freedom while being himself. I love it!
I feel personally attacked with the placement of Kix.
Oml I love Life🤧
We need more Jamie STAT!
jamie is the smolest bean he must be protecc <3
Eugene: I don't want kids
Eugene has always been my favourite
I don’t  eat  cearial and ugine is my fave try guy I’m rite your rong shut up
The dancing line music in the background
I always knew cinnamon toast crunch would be Eugene’s fav
If Eugene had a child, this is what they’d be like.
YES!!! This is finally the video where I agree with ALL OF EUGENES RANKS! 
wheaties and Total are the worst on the planet!!
I hope he gets his own channel and calls it Big Mood.
Where can I find a friend like Jamie?
"We're both probably going to lose our hair" - straight savage
cinnamon toast crunch was my favorite as a kid !!
This kid is going to be a gay icon and I'm here for it
Yo! I love this kid, someone give this guy a job lol!
Anyone else notice Eugene is using almond milk? I wonder if there's a reason or just preference.
Never before has such a controversial video been undertaken
I’m so offended that this child placed fruity pebbles so low I still love them now as an adult and I did at his age too
Eugene chose my favourite cereal as his fave... But in the UK it's Curiously Cinnamon and the packaging is better so they're even better than the US version 😉
The mascot is an apple and cinnamon stick
No offense but Jamie is the coolest kid I’ve ever seen
If Jamie ain't the 5th try guy now, I am leaving with my subscription.
Cinnamon Toast Crunch is #1 in my heart too.
Okay where did you find Jamie? He and Eugene are an iconic duo.
I’m a couple years older than Jamie but I agree with Eugene way more I’m so old what
This child is SENDING ME 
Omg the Froot Loops fact has me dead
Definitely would love to see a collab with shane dawson
I just had the Reese’s for the first time recently. Oh man is that tasty. I’ve been a Honey Nut Cheerios girl forever. And Frosted Mini Wheats. That’s my order and I’m sticking to it.
Aaron Paul in the pop’s commercial 😭😭😭😭🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
Eugene: let's put the milk first
Literally my order Cinnamon Toast Crunch is the best
So many damn cereals that I have never ever had
Id have to agree with the kid honestly
Cinnamon Toast Crunch and Capn Crunch are my childhood favourites. Crunch mouth was a price but still.
“Maybe I should just go home, and chug a glass of corn!”
Jamie needs to have some recurring appearances in future Try Guy videos <3
Finally i found a try guys fan thats my age
I would not mind seeing more buddy antics between Eugene and Jamie!
OMG THIS KID!!! He's definitely the fifth tryguy!
Am I the only one who distinctly remembers Apple Jacks having two mascots.
This kid gets to eat breakfast with EUGENE.
I am personally attacked by the life
I'm a very picky eater but I actually really liked (and still do) raisin bran  as a child
Next video should 100% be eugene ranks the try guys on multiple categories
“Who’s your favourite try guy?”
I agree with Eugene, Cinnamon Toast Crunch is the best cereal ever
I feel like this kid is grown up Wes ,who hangs out with uncle Eugene all the time.😂
Living for the Kellogg facts, it needed to be said
i love this kid hahahaha
"Let's see if I'll be disappointed or excited about Life" Jamie, 2019
;-; I loved raisin bran as a kid
I can't like this video becuase he put Trix so low 😭😭😭
Um, where are the crunch berries!?
I just realized at the end of the video the promotion for the tour Zach is junko posing
This child is so well spoken and deliberate with his words, love him
I swear this kid is amazing if he’s not in any other videos I’m gonna throw a riot
Is it wrong that I haven't eaten cereal in my whole entire life?
okay wait when this kid said he wants to see conspiracy videos with shane... my heart
At 26:51 you can actually see Eugene suddenly have that intention to kill someone
cinnamon toast crunch was always my fav as a kid this is great
top three: cocoa pebbles (where?! how?!), cinnamon toast crunch, captain crunch.
EXCUSE ME WHERE ARE THE GOLDEN GRAMS
Corn flakes was created on accident if I remember correctly.
This kid NEEDS to get adopted by the Try Guys. His banter is so sharp and on point!
can i just say, as someone who is hard of hearing. i LOVE that your team takes the time to actually make sure the closed captioning is on your videos.  youtubes auto generated captions are not working and have not been working for a long while and its really frustrating. I appreciate who ever does your captions.  give them a raise... or fire youtube.. your choice
This kid is amazing! What a legend!
I love Jamie oml
No hate He’s so judgmental 😂
If my kids don't turn out to be as funny as Jamie I'm sending them back
eugene literally hates kids but every time a kid comes on he absolutely loves it
We have hardly any of these cereals in australia and they are all called different things:
Now in 10ish years Jamie can come back and see if his ranking is still the same or more similar to Eugene's ranking!
I want to have this kid to be my child. You got a son and a funny, frank friend all in one haha
This kid is more confident than I’ll ever be
Fun Fact: Jamie is the 6th try guy
Jamie is my favorite try guy
Okay, I'm 4 minutes in and Jamie is A W E S O M E. What an amazingly witty and hilarious personality he's got! That delivery *chef's kiss*! I also adore how much of a kick Eugene is getting out of this xD! Edit: YES! I 1000% agree with Eugene's pick for number 1! Best cereal hands down! Unfortunately, where I live, they've lowered the sugar content since I was a child and things have never been quite the same...
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THE BERRIES IN CAPN CRUNCH?!?!? WHERE'D THEY GO???
3 things. 1) I love this kid  please have him on again 2) Cinnamon Toast Crunchbis 100% the best and 3) love you Eugene ❤❤❤🌽🥣
I LOVE THIS CHILD
Jamie needs to feature in more videos. He is the best!!!
I have never heard of like a third of these. This video needed Weet-Bix.
Why is Jamie so funny- he’s beyond his years
Wait wait waitwaitwait... they specify frosted now?!
You should do an episode where you mix cereals and rank the best combos.
I'm not sure if this is the best video I've ever seen, or if It's 35 minutes of my life I'll never get back. There is no in between.
13:40.  #9 now i can say "i hate life"
Jamie talks like a full-time Buzzfeed employee 😂
8:45 omg it's Jesse
Jamie is amazing- rank king is improved 3000% by this kid
Holy crap he reminds me of the little girl from dog with a blog
special k with strawberries is THE ONLY CEREAL EVER
Why do I feel like the kid could be Ned and Ariels son
I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO GET TRIX IN TORONTO SOMEONE HELP ME!!!!
That kid does my head in
Finally, someone else thinks Cinnamon Toast Crunch is the best cereal
Yo I'm 12 and I love raisin bran so that got me mad
Eugene has found the only child he will ever like. 🤣
Seattle WA finally but I'm not going because Moore theater is haunted
Even the kid is feminine af lmao
who's gonna tell eugene about french toast crunch
y'all, froot loops are just gay cheerios or queerios. thank you and goodnight.
Why is their chemistry better than most movie actors I've seen?
Soo long. I think this could have been split into two different videos. I watched all of it and now I have no time for other videos because I have adulting to do. sigh*
Jamie is HILARIOUS. Please bring him on again! He also needs his own channel!
How old is this child? I love him.
Yeeeeeeaaaaahhhhh InYALL F....ING FACEES CINNOMON TOAST CRUNCH IN THE BEEEEEEST BOOOOOO YAAAAAAAAAAH
I just had a thought: Try guys try being mermaids.
I saw myhero academia xD lol
Eugene should rank generic vs name brand cereals!
25:56 Did anyone else stop to like and comment on this video? 
CAPN CRUNCH WAS SOOOOO CLOSE NOOOOOO
This boy is a 40 year old women stuck inside a child’s body
Apple Jacks did too have a mascot
I’m so with Eugene. Well played.
Id like to see him make fun of all the try guys again
I have never heard Corn Pops called just "Pops" and I didn't realize how much it would bother me. Haha. Sometimes I think Canada and the U.S. are super similar, and then this happens. 🤷‍♀️😂
Eugene: "You will love Honey Bunches of Oats when you get to college."
Ah so cute! 😍
Blessed be the froot loops
Lol Eugene is gonna have a midlife crisis when he one day wakes up and the desire to have kids overwhelms him
When did they get the shapes back in trix?
Froot loops are just the gay cheerios 
I’m 22 with the taste of an 11 year old
i love this kid he’s so funny
My favorite is Raisin Bran and im 14 haha
give my daughter cookie crisps because shes two and she thinks shes eating cookies for breakfast..
If Eugene and Ned had a son this little guy would be him
Bring him back! This kid was hilarious!
How old is this kid? It’s like he was made to be in the media! 
am i the only one that keeps coming back to this video for some reason lol
3:55 you mean con fleis
jamie has the voice of a 7 year old, the height of an 11 year old and the personality of a teenager
frosted wheats are amazing. and where's Golden Grahams?
Where are the Sugar Smacks? That was my fave.
Eugene with a kid.....is perfection.
I will watch Jamie for hours
Eugene: I don’t want kids 
I have an iron deficiency, so I enjoy all cereals.
