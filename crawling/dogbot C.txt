SONY:MAKES ROBOT DOG
Is nobody going to talk how this robot dog is actually really cute
Doesn’t need food and water
But Real dog will love you more than his life ☺️☺️
Dogs: exist
I changed this comment so the replies don’t make any sense
i gave mine a bath and it stopped working ):
Thief breaks into the house 🏠
I swear japan never fails to make something cute
im the only one who feels sad about what's going to happen on the future?
Guy: so what breed is your dog?
This is actually amazing for people that are like allergic to dogs, like me
Are we realizing that he’s literally playing with a dog robot
I bought the $4000 Sony Aibo robotic CAT........it just walked away from me and slept in a corner!
Person 1: I have a German Shepherd! 
Detroit become good boy

Friend: so what breed is he?
Friend: So, what type of dog do you have?
when you are rich and you don't know how to spend money
I shouldn’t get it because I will end up personally loving it and then it will break and I will cry
My mom won’t buy me a real dog but she might buy me a robot dog
No matter how smart
get this when you're alone in life and allergic to dogs 😂
My dog legit started barking and I'm like why am I watching this 😂
I can't wait for the human version to come out to destroy our race for good!
I told my dog to go to it’s charging station and it went and took a shit in my bathtub.
Me: Mom can we get a dog?
Im a dog and I find this offensive.
Played with one today at the Sony center in Fukuoka 🇯🇵. Its quite amazing. It really seems to have a personality..... even trying to bite my friends hand when he/she didnt like being touched somewhere 😂😂😂😂...
"That's the last time I become friends with a rich sociopath and his pet robot."
From this , I can realize a dangerous future ahead, can you ?
Yo if these things ever overtake real dogs imma going to die
Mine left a pile of batteries in the middle of my kitchen floor.  Sort this out, Sony.
When you realize that it's extremely expensive and extremely is useless
Sony in 1945: Fixes broken radios
"CAN HE GET UP FROM THERE"
It was whining, so I took it outside.
When all of the animals extinct Sony: let’s make more robot animals
I'm already emotionally attached to it :'(
If I was 9 years old and I got that
Friend: so do you have a dog?
me: can I have a Sony Aibo  dog                          My mom: you can have a little live pet

I feel like hes a real dog and when i see him walk its just cute and im like hes gonna die one day But actualky he isnt and im happy about that
This is looking actually both terrafying and impressive :/
omg when the dog was signing it was so cute!
Great for a person who lost a pet dog because it never dies, well it does if you break it, but who would?
Well, if this doesn’t make you smile, nothing will!

A real dog, you bring to the vet. This one: "ship it in a sealed box through UPS and we'll take a look at it"
I mean I have a real dog and seeing the similarities is awesome, this is also VERY good for people who are allergic to dogs or animals in general and still want a pet
When your dog is smarter than you.

*Gives him a bath *
Next video: 'I'm switching back to the Sony Aibo'... Thumbnail: Facepalm

Yeah but the reason I get dogs is to make there life better, it’s not for my purpose, making this thing useless for me
2038: Detroit Become Doggo. 
Gotta love when someone pays $3000 for a electronic dog when you can get a real one for less then half the price
It better drive me, make me fly to the moon, and tuck me in bed for that price.
Your a proper American shouting and over reacting lol
It’ll be sad if this replaces real dogs :(
reading the title : overpriced AF
WOAH THIS IS AMAZING
The best thing u have unboxed till now! Amazing

I’m crying
Can you over volt it 😂
Oh man He's rich he always buy robots literary
I am a wallet and I find this offensive.
Awww it's so cute awwwwwww
This'll end up on a Newsflare feel good story about an abandoned robot dog found living on a building site, rusted & low on batteries etc etc ....
0:50 "iBone" yes you currently do

That's it... I'm moving to Japan!!!
Any1 thinks this looks animated 🤣
When you can afford a real dog so you just buy this
Sony dog : kicks the ball 
me thinking of why i spent money on iphones
Friend- So what breed is your dog?
NO MEMORIES 
This is almost disturbing on how well it works
So freaking cute 😍
3:38 The last thing you hear before you die
This reminds me of the love I have with my Minecraft dog
4:10 why does he walk like a grandma
Form all the years of watching your videos this had made me smile the most.
OH MY GOD!!!!!!!! ITS SOOOOOOOOO CUTE !!! AWWW
This is actually so cute omg
Imagine going to a museum in the year 3000 to see an extinct dog. 😢😢 I hope technology doesn’t take it too far.
$3000 noooo
All the people in the comments (pet owners, most likely) feel so attacked right now, dismissing it and saying how it doesn’t compare to the real deal. Of course it doesn’t, that’s not the point. It’s not out to replace your dog, it’s just a cool display of tech, a toy meant to replicate somewhat of dog behavior. Lol
A blooded dog will remain as it's coz that robo will never provide any feelings but good job keep it up
The best thing about this dog is this cant bite us hahah😂
3:38 ok
This is amazing
911 Whats Your emergency?
aibo: ur weak 
Present: real dogs
He feel me so haapy...
Really wanna know what happened to the aibo so badly !! :")
It's not bringing a pet to school if it's a robot right.
why is this in my recommendations
ITS SO AMAZING ITS LIKE WOW!!
Bruh I'll take a real dog for that I'll just smash it for content
Aibo looks like an animation and its scaring me ;v;
People in the 1980s "we will have flying cars!" People today, "We have robot dogs!".
I just passed out of excitement!!
From dog being kept to keep ourselves  safe to saving dog from being stolen. we've come a long way
Friend:So what breed is your dog 
Wait for the AI to become strong and this thing might even bite you 😂
Douse It Have A Headphone Jack?
This is amazing
I cant stop laughing when dog pick up the bone damn funny video brother
Why do I have an urge to smash that thing. 😂
Nothing on earth can replace the love of a real dog🐶🐕💘❤️
No matter how old we are, toys really makes us child for moment. 🤗🤗
Great now my dog is jealous because I pay too much attention to Aibo XD
I'll have to get one to keep my bunny entertained while I'm gone
Ahhh i like that its so cute
Please tell me where you bought this dog I’m looking forward to buying it for my daughters birthday
This could be really good for people who are severely allergic to dogs
NOOO PLEASE DONT REPLACE DOGS THEIR MANS BEST FRIEND AND JUST IMAGINE IF EVERYONE GOT THIS I LOVEEE DOGS WITH ALL MY HEART AND THIS JUST BREAKS MY HEART💔
this blows my mind
My real dog would rip that things head off lol 😂😂😂😂🤣
Awwwww it's so cute
Those who disliked probably watched Black Mirror 😂
Amazing product I love it
Damn man I want that robot dog right now hahaha
Never seen something so cute and useless at the same time. When you see in 15 minutes what he can do what remains after is just regret.  Thanks for the video!
That dog 🐶 is Japanese shepherd.
"My name is Aibo, I'm the Android sent by Cyberlife, ruff!"
I know my dog would go crazy if he saw this robot😂
In a parallel universe dogs are experimenting with humanoid  robot master
It looks like it's animated! It's simply MINDBLOWING AND REALISTIC! I wonder what next generations will be like IF we have one......
Aww this thing is so cute.
Unfortunately, I am renting a smart home and robot dogs aren't allowed.
is that axl haha😂
Wow that is really cool I want one now he looks so cute
Nobody :
Gives me that 2019 chucky vibe
i'd rather spend 3000 dollars on this robot dog then buying an Iphone X. xD
I am watching a mannp playing with a robtic dog full of codes what am I doing with my life
Yeah, I'm going to stick to my $10 rescue dog.
Wow this is so amazing
Beautiful video best technical review  thanks for unbox therapy me 👍
I think in another 50 years this robot able to mimic movement as regular dogs.
Aaaawww sssoooooo cuuutteee
Where can I buy this!!

I want one😂 lol cant afford
That dog is super adorable
HOW ADORABLE!   I love your excitement,  like a little kid at Christmas!  Maybe the price will come down a bit so us middle class folks can purchase one. Thank you for the unboxing as always very ENTERTAINING!
That was really great ! But I am upset too ! Science will destroy everything . Being a civil Engineer I can say it ! We are going wrong way .😑😑.
Amazing!
🔥
Much better then iphone Xs
This is weird!! HAHA I DIED
Do you buy all the items in all your video 
Sooooooooooooooooooooooooo......

If all humans went extinct I wonder how long this thing could live its own life
dog is Highest price but real dog are cheap price so don't waste money😂😂
6:28 yup was just in the movies but now everything is getting real nowadays.
Someone get this man a puppy! :)
Awwww so cute!!!💕😍🤗
Plot twist: the government is controlling the cameras and watching your every move
The coolest thing is it never dies💛☝
It’s no where close to a real dog for a real dog you have love and you love it but in a bot lmao bots are BOTS
Sony Aibo Robot Dog more like FBI Undercover Dog
When a robot can make an adult male think it is cute and actually think it has feelings that means it was made excellenty. The way he laughed when that robot looked at him. That was the cutest. On that note, I need one in my life.
imagine seeing someone take this for a walk
This is so cute.. Japanese really can make some serious machines.. :)
SOOOOO QUTEEEEEEEEEEE
So freaking cute!
Ok so when are they making terminators.
The best thing it will never die.
Techincal Guruji Left the chat
I checked the price of 3000 $ in Google in rupees 2 lakh 14 thousands
The most  cutest thing I've ever seen
That was epic!!!! Its just a step towards our future
This is where detroid become human becomes truth
u can get a real dog for. this price but yeah u do u
Wala kang kwenta!!bobo!
This is almost as expensive as my labradoodle
That's more cute than a real dog. It obeys and learn sooo fast.
All that's left is Google assistant integration, and i'm sold.
I just ordered this Sony Aibo for my Humanoid 🤖 robot ... ✌🤘😎
I will buyed😊.
Sir this so cute 😫🙏🙏💓 please give me one please
I want one😂
If u give it to Jerry rig everything, he will teardown that robot, do couple of drop test, durability test and burn it ☹️
2019?
pets in September 21 after we raid Area 51
I have to imagine the novelty wears off quick.
I want one of these dogs for Christmas but the reason I want it is really sad.
i expect that apple will launch a cat robot on september
Even if I bought it, it would probably spend its life in my storage boxes under the bed for 15 years(Like my lost PS2) and finally when I do, there will be better alternatives
I do that this is 2019 but are you still keeping it
This was insane!!
And this is why I named my dog Sony Aibo
Imagine this thing turning itself on at night, when you sleep to destroy your xbox.😂😂😂
I need this toy!
Say self destruct 😂😂
liking it :)
yeah this is cool but anyone remember our og i d o g
Some of its movements are oddly realistic 
year 2030:
Ohhhhhhh mannnnn !
😂👏👏👏👏
This is cute and all but I can’t imagine it replacing a real friend 🐕
Year 2040
Can a chiropractor enhance the movement of it?

This legit sound like Rick and Monty 3:37
I'd get this just so my dog has someone to play with. Then again I'm pretty sure my dog would kill this thing in the first hour and meanwhile I'd still have 47 more payments to make on it.

Hear me out on this. I know the price tag is kind of high. But I think this would be the perfect toy/dog for senior homes and kids that's probably allergic to dogs or some type of pets. I think it's actually cool to have something like this....

Sony : Makes robo-dog
Cute not $3000 cute! For 3000 it better make breakfast and fetch the paper.
How the frick did you afford that?
CGI?
Wait in 5 years they will probably have perfected this and also made a human version...
A real dog has real emotions 
No poop is the best part lol 😂🤣
LOL with 3000$ you could probably buy a real dog 😂
Lewis: good boy
😍😍😍😍
Wow.amazing 😮😮😮
Best thing is that this dog don't do poops!!!
The end is near
My dog can pee on a pole
sony u have smart mind people
This is cool
The real question is, can it shoot lasers?
Who else got emotional raise your hands
Gets the dog and says  😙😙😙😍
Microsoft: makes xbox and computers that are pretty good. Sony: Imma end this man's whole career. Microsoft:sees dog. ;_;
We have that thing
The dog is cute!
Real dogs are even more better,but still ,what a cute thing !
But it doesn't have emotions or doesn't feel guilty if it destroys something by the dogs are the best atleast they have emotions ❤🐕
Why would someone pay 3000$ for a robotic dog? I can have more fun with a 80$ video game
Jesus Christ, even a android dog is cute.
Doggy roboto saves the internet binge

You should start a new channel how to do over acting

Yeah, this is one of those Uncanny Valley products. You guys realize for 3 grand you could get  pure breds of a poofy cloud like a Samoyed, hell you could get a Mastiff or a Chow Chow or a Siberian Husky or an Australian Shepherd or a etc. etc. I guess the plus side is not having to pick up shit but you can train a dog to make it an easier task
😲😲👍
Robotic Pet

Apple should invent one of these.
This dog gonna be the the next terminatior
50 years from now, they will run and look like a real puppy
Childhood dream but there wasn't robot's in that time
Wow. In 20 years hence...???
Wow thats cool
For a second I couldn't tell if the dog was blinking or it was just me
I HAVE TO SAY THE LITTLE ROBODOG  IS CUTE LOL😀❤👍

Loneliness is the future judging by what products are being created now.

Still a toy anyway
For $250-300? This thing would FREAKING AMAZING! 
Whats the use of it
Cool and cute ▼・ᴥ・▼
That’s hopefully not the future
Nothing can compare to a real one
The movement look like it was  CGI
Robot cat doesn't take instructions , it just sits there judging you.

But not feelings
Just get a real dog for $3000
Jesus christ this is scary good

Don’t forget to charge your dog.
For people who want an immortal dog

The great thing about this DOG is that it will not bite you.
And russian hacker put an AI algorithm inside it
Metal doggo
3000 for a robot dog? Why did you not spend only 700 for an husky?
Hi if you want to download angry birds 2 then see my channel
So, what would happen if I kick or hurt the dog?

Why
Incredible
Getting your finger stuck in that mouth....
I don't know man, I prefer a real dog.
If you are alergic to dogs, here ya go, if you aren't allowed a dog in your rental home, here ya go.
not a he or her, A it !
Where???
‘YEET’
This is great for people who are unable to have pets due to allergies or living environments.
Imagine in the dark... only eyes glow... and it is moving towards you.
Machine learning depending robot... algorithm which is used in it makes him to perform the task which is given to him in the of instructions..becoZ this robot already have been experience on the the given task...but if I give him other task to do robot system will fail since it doesn't have an experience on that particular task
Very cool i wish that my dog

2018 robot dog...I'm  waiting for androids in 2038...cyberlife
so cute.. no
If i show this to my dog he will murder it my dog:whos this me:its a robot puppy my dog:i will murder him while he sleeps
It's cute, it's great tech, it works, it's an excellent option for those who can't have pets due to living arrangements or allergies.. But is it worth 3k? Probably not. Pleo, the robot dinosaur, came out nearly 10 years ago and was VERY similar in its capabilities, except it couldn't go to its charge doc automatically. Pleo was only £300, and while it has some bugs and most no longer work after 10yrs, is still very comparible.
But this dog can't protect you
He is more obeying then the real one
Smart robot and cute
I want
Nice
U shouldve told it to jump off the table
3:58 get someone who looks at you like aibo looks at him
He protecc 
So you're telling me I got a lousy 'real' dog and had to give buttloads of time training it and cleaning up after it...

"I bone" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😁😢😬🤣🤣🤣
My dog looked at the screen and walked away.Hes sitting in the corner now. I think he feels hurt 😂
Every time I begged my parents to give me a robot dog this is what I was envisioning lol.
Nobody: 
1982:WE WILL HAVE FLYING CARS IN THE FUTURE

You can buy two new dogs instead of this
I laughed at your reaction when you said "This is weird" its the way you say it but that Robot Dog is amazing!!

Who said money doesn't buy happiness
Sony is amazing. 😂 but for real, that's really cool how he can interact with real world objects, and know where they are.... It's so cool that it's almost crazy lol. 🤷🏻‍♂️ but $3,000 I would have to pass on that, buts it's really cool regardless.

I would buy a real dog
Hamhe dog haseli
It's looks like a cgi!!
With that money you could've gotten a real dog
His  so cute
This is funny lol
its zo coool
If only it had a soul
this reminds me of that sea lion type toy that lisa and bart simpson invented on the simpsons, except this one doesnt get evil and try to kill you :P
is it just me or he is a bit creepy
I thought the port would be in the butt of the dog
I am personally expect that the robot can somehow learn like real dogs. That would be interesting though..
I wonder what an iBone X would be like
Do Androids dream of Electric Sheep?
Well hello there sony. Long time no see.
It’s a cool gimmick for kids if you have rich parents. But anyone with a real dog knows there is no comparison. My dog is chilling by my feet while I watch this in the bathroom. 😎
It Reminds Me the Power Rangers SPD Dog🙄
Genuine smile came out while watching this video..
Aibo life time cost: 3,009
To all those who are saying get a real dog, just stfu. If this gives happiness to someone then what the hell is ur problem.
This thing is more expensive than my dog 🐶
Dog chose to be deviant.
THIS IS THE BEST VIDEO EVER PUBLISHED IN THIS CHANNEL. MAN, THAT'S SOOOOOO COOL!!
Nothing can replace a real pet dog.
I don’t have enough money to buy a rolex. I guess I’ll just buy a robot dog.
Best dog for people who lives in a apartment and don't have space to keep a real one and who don't have time to take him to a walk
This is the beginning of the end
i want to know what would be the reaction of real dog when it sees this robot 🤔
i cant believe that im watching this with my dog on my side.. 
His movement is so craziest 😘

Now this might seem stupid but

This just makes me more of a cat-lover. Try making a cat A.I... Charges 75% of the time, doesn't follow instructions, trolls you for not interacting with it. Wake me when computers can do that lol.
Plot twist: this dawg is part of five nights at freddy
I'd rather buy a real dog that's 1/3rd of the price.
It can't protect from burglars.
why is everyone so afraid of robots taking over the world?... 
A robot dog that reacts to things you say and can make music....this is the future
One more way to spying us :) Great job
The 3k dollars of happiness... i love it!
That thing is really cute.. I want one. forget phone upgrade I am getting this.

OMFG 😍 WHY AM I SEEING THIS SO LATE?! I ❤️IT
Remember when we used to interact with real mammals?
Name him Sony!!
actually where I live pets aren't allowed... so this would be a great way to experience a bit of the fun of what an actual pet is like
Both a real dog and this robotic dog are great in their own way
Finally we are in future ....
Can you stream music to this via Bluetooth? I would get it just to have a doggo boombox haha
RUFF RUFF MOFOFUCKA
Just think that it could be watching you while you sleep...

You should keep the robot dog in every video and see if the dog agrees with what ever your talking about in the videos you make
