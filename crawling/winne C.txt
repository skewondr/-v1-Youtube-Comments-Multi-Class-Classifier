Who else came here only to see how she puts her foundation on ?
My cousin Shanya has vitiligo and she has one white hand and one black hand and has been faking a relationship for a year now(by taking hand holding pictures)- if thats not iconic I don’t know what is.
I came here to see how she puts the foundation on, but now I'm just in shock that she applies her face mask with a FORK
Winnie ya not supposed to use a metal spoon with the aztec clay wahhh
When she put the eye drops in my eyes started watering and I couldn’t stop blinking
All the comments are stop hating on her but i CANT find any hate comment 😭
Anyone else couldn’t stop looking at her lips?? They’re perfect 😭
I can’t believe people give her a hard time for covering her EYELIDS when most ppl wouldn’t have the courage to not cover their whole face with foundation if they had the same skin condition. Kudos to her 🤙🏼
Use me as a: WE NEED ZENDAYA NEXT button 😭♥️
Can we all take a minute to appreciate Winnie’s beauty she is a true winner
Please people who will try the clay mask after this: don't use metal when mixing
I discoverd her on america's next top model and sadly she wasn't one of the nice ones ..
I wish society accepted Michael Jackson's vitiligo as they're doing with Winnie and others. All I remember that he was crucified by Every media platform about something he couldn't control.
Zendaya next please, I've been asking for soooo long 😭
She's the definition of artist, painting her master piece on her beautiful self
“I wish I had bushy brows”
The foundation part 10:10 :) thank me later 😀
vinegar on your face seems like a bad idea
beauty gurus: uses overpriced brushes to apply masks
“You have to protect yourself no matter what job you’re in” 
I’ve had vitiligo for 20 years, and I’ve never been more confident in my life.. ♥️
I love how she tries not to cover her vitiligo at all, especially around her eye area ❤️
Shes using a metal fork for that mask, oh no :(
no hate but I will never forget how ungrateful she was to Tyra banks...
Her lips looked better before the make up. 
when she showed the pic of her eyebrows before , i mean ive never related to something more
she’s honestly so beautiful i can’t
I’m just shocked that she doesn’t use spf especially with her vitiligo? Not trying to hate just a comment
I really love her personality, and she's also very pretty
BRO I LOVED THIS WOMAN, SHE IS BEAUTIFUL, FUNNY AND SENSATIONAL.
wtf???? she started the video so i thought: omg she ready, but no, it's just the perfection of her.
You are really beautiful I don’t mean that way  welp your more prettier then me
I absolutely love how Winnie embraces her skin, she's so stunning is every single way
God is a women. And like this.
please bring Aubrey Plaza so that she can show us her makeup
we need Willow Smith skin care routine/make up time!!!!!!!!!
this called me ugly in 7 different languages
I can't get over her lips. I mean they look like somebody drew them. They are THAT perfect.
Her face is almost like a proof the existence of god/something bigger, just look at it! So beautiful and unique
Who else loves that she avoids her white parts such a beautiful woman
she is so beautiful and she is herself I have egzima I be myself you go girl
Very interesting. I never seen skin like that and I genuinely came to see how you do your makeup. Very good! 😁 beautiful skin ❤️
she has the most beautiful lips wtf 😭😭😭😍😍😍
Ohkay she's vitiligo and she does not cover it. Because she's been sold out only because she has vitiligo
10:14 that’s the reason why I love her so much.  
What are the eye drops she used to make eyes whiter?
She's got the perfect lips 🤧
Please bring lana del rey to do her make up
"I wish I had big bushy brows" wtf you HAVE big bushy brows
You're not supposed to use metal tools with the Aztec clay mask 😭 when she did thag my heart hurt.
She’s so beautiful with or without makeup 💘
She is Soo beautiful and is such an inspiration to girls. I love her so much
Omg I looked on her lips whole vid, they're gorgeous
am i the only one that doesnt like her bc of how mean she was in antm? lmao
I really wanna know what the brand is of the eye drops she puts in in the beginning? 🥰
She’s so beautiful 🥺❤️
My cousin has vitiligo she wasn't born with it so when she got it she cried but now she loves it
She had to give an explanation as to why she was covering her eyelids. She must have been slightly scared of getting backlash for that. It is crazy that these people cannot do anything without getting backlash and being criticised. 
My late mother had vitiligo and I thought she was a special and most beautiful woman I'd ever seen.
She’s beautiful 😭😍
Who else puts EYEDROPS on their face?!?!
“Cause this lace is expensive” me too
Why do I feel like this isn’t how her personality actually is, it all seems so forced.
Was that a fork she used😂❤
Really i love how you're different mix with Caramel's skin and pale white very gorgeous❤❤
She’s gorgeous but I kept wondering about the fairer areas of her skin and sun exposure. I’d imagine vitiligo patients mush be very cautious with sunscreen and outdoor activities.
She's the most gorgeous woman! I like her skin.
We need Blake Lively next!! Imagine how fun it’d be
when you lived through the days of dark liner and lip gloss and thought we'd moved past it and it's now coming back. why.
MARAVILHOSA! Assisti o video inteiro em inglês, sem legendaaaa E EU NEM FALO INGLÊS. ❤️😍
She is courageous, confident, beautiful and I love her.. I know people give her a hard time to me our imperfections make us who we are none of us is perfect...
Eye drops on your skin to get the red out?!! 🤯 amazing!!
I love her but her past ruined the vibe of this video
I just realised that everyone is beautiful sometimes it just takes the right person to see it😍😍
Winnie after makeup lowkey looks like Kim's twinn
imagine she bought two different foundationf or each-
Her skin actually looked really good after her homemade mask.😘
you’re not supposed to use metal in aztec clay, right?
Her eyeshadow is so bad
Beautiful person and a warm, friendly personality. What’s not to love !!!
I’m going to be honest, when I saw the thumbnail, I thought that this video was of someone with white skin, doing their foundation as if they were black. I’m in awe at the confidence you have to not cover up the lighter skin. I don’t judge anyone who has this condition if they do cover up but I wish I had your confidence! 
Dona Vogue podia colocar uma legendinha pra nós que ñ terminanos o cursinho de inglês!
Please make one of these videos with Blake Lively!!!
my new idol is you🥰🍀youre so pretty for me🥰🥰🥰
Ariana Grande next please i've been waiting for her so long 😭😭
As soon as I clicked this video I saw an amazing model
Tbh, couldn't stand her in ANTM😂😂😂
No one:
I also have vitiligo and feel uncomfortable, especially when I am in bikini.
Omg im pregnant she's gorgeous
I love how she accept who she is. I love u🙋
she's so beautiful. for real.
She is the epitome of “beautiful on the outside, ugly on the inside”
大好き(*♥д♥*)！もっともっとこの方の動画を見たい！どこかに無いかな？Twitterとかインスタとか無いかな？あればぜひフォローしたい😊
it's so insane that vitiligo even exists. the human body is so insane. also winnie is so incredibly likeable
素敵！でも、可愛いさがあって惚れる🤭
ชั้นชอบความเป็นตัว​เอง​เเบบนี้🥰💗
This woman has a sour personality.. Her attitude is not beautiful
I love her confidence.
She is so beautiful 😍 
this video is so relaxing i love this look her voice is so soothing
Lots of love for you girl, keep on slaying
I can't like her after ANTM and I feel very bad for that 😅
I wanna see once when the mouth area are covered,  just to see how it looks 😅
Let me take a moment to say, YOU R BEAUTIFUL!
Eu amo essa Mulher 😍❤
This is my 2nd time watching her video! Hello guys! Let's be friends❤️ hit like!
I thought she was pretty down to earth in the video but then I saw the comment section.....
SHE SAID THE BRUSH LOOKS LIKE A CATS PAW OMGGGG SO CUTE
Omg I love her so much <3
I've never known her before but now i love her already 🥰
Beautiful inside & out. Here's to your successes and many more to come! 🍾
i heard she's mean in real life. don't be fooled guys

Winnie has SUCH a beautiful smile! Adore!
She looks so beautiful I love her skin it’s amazing I’ve never seen one of these people do makeup I love you gurl :3 your perfect AND YOUR A MODEL woah :3
She’s so beautiful 💗
She’s stunning but her attitude isn’t going to cut it 😭😭😭
This was a really good upload. She killed all of my curiosities. Hopefully, they do an Albino model next💜
When mixing Aztec clay, I thought it said not to mix it with a metal utensil? 🤭
She’s just so beautiful 😍😽
Your skin is amazing!! Your so beautiful. ❤️
her lips are so perfect and pretty I cant stop looking at them 💕💕💕
Metal messes up the bentonite clay. If you're going to use it, mix with none metal utensils.
انتي جميله وفديوهاتك حلووه 😉✌💖
She’s so unique and so beautiful🤩💜
I love how she put her face mask on with a fork
I've always wondered how sis did her foundation
Yessss, ive been waiting for this video!! Been confused about how to do my own makeup with vitiligo for so long 😂
That lace is LAIDDDDT 🔥🔥
I absolutely LOVE Winnie ❤️✨
I love how she uses fork to apply her mask gracefully.
u aren’t supposed to mix the aztec clay mask with a metal utensil,,,,,
Your not supposed to use metal with the clay mask 😭
I'm a Japanese
She's so freekin gorgeous 💖
She's so beautiful! ❤️
You may be pretty but what if the world was blind, who would you impress?
she is stunning ♥
I was wondering about the method u follow for fondation to keep this beautiful face colour u have... it’s good to be special and beautiful ❤️
This was on my recommend and I'm glad I watched it
God bless & save all of the world 
“I wish I had fuller brows” 
She's so GOOOJUSS! I CANT
I was holding my breath when she had that fork near her eyes, oh my GOD.
Pro tip:
かっこいいい好きぃぃ

Michael Jackson también tenia esa enfermedad Vitiligo ..
@mixedmakeup needs this beautiful girl!

She’s absolutely beautiful ❤️❤️🥰
I love this girl so much🤩
Winnie Harlow is just GORGEOUS !  😩❤️
Ur not suppose to use any kind of metal wen using ashtec clay mask and apple cider. Its written at the back of the tub.
I’ve always been terrified of eye drops 🙈😂😱
I'm so proud of you sis you deserve the best 👍💕
You’re gorgeous ❤️
i love this shes amazing i love her confidence
Vogue. Please make this  video or 72 questions with Lana Del Rey 💕
Wow, a model using drug store skin care products !! I stan
You can't use a metal fork with green clay bc it loses all its properties !!!
Love how she used the eye drops on her skin ❤️
After I watched this video now I want to name my future child Winnie
Umm...the first thing on the Aztec Clay container tells you not to let the clay come into contact with metal.
I love her! wow Ive never seen her talk? shes so real and cute and raw <3
this is so beauifual thnak you for the video x
Wow. Her skin is genuinely so cool!!! I’m amazed 😱😱😍
She's so Gorgeous 😍
Now if only she stopped calling dark skin girls roaches.
Gorgeous ❤️
That orange 🍊 confusion 😂💖
This is the most beautiful beauty tutorial ever
生きるスタイル、ポジティブな考え方、振る舞い方がチャーミングでとても美しいです✨✨
I'll never forgive her for what she was like on ANTM. She is so fake
what was the first brand of eyedrops?
아 존나 징그러워 그냥...
Omg. She's beautiful and a true inspiration. I also have vitiligo and she has inspired me to show my skin as it is. Thank you for this Vogue ❤️
she's so pretty!! ❤️
WHERE IS ZENDAYA VOGUE CONSIDER THIS AN ULTIMATUM
Thank you, love the video ^^
Never realised her eyebrows are that great !! Love them
wow, she's so beautiful in every possible way.
She’s art 💕
Gigi hadid 
winnie, thank you. your confidence in yourself truly inspires me. your a wonderful role model, for everyone especially, young/teen girls in this generation it can be hard, because we all have so many insacurities, with social media and stuff. but, thank you, your just so beautiful inside and out!! xx
She is soooo beautiful! ❤️
She has really nice lips 😌
انا عندي مرض البهاق ربنا يشفيني يارب😭
Didn't she make fun of another black celebrities natural hair ?? And everything I've read about her is that she's a pretty sour person.  She cute but not that cute....
I never knew that Winnie was canadian
Omg, you're so beautiful
wow i never heard of putting eye drops on skin lol
I LOVE what she stands for!  I think she's so frickin beautiful and she seems to have such a warm, kind energy and that's so, so cool.
you are so incredibly beautiful!  everything you are doing is perfect. it's good to start with , but you could do entirely the wrong thing and still be right, because you are a wonderful soul, and it shines outward. :)
She did that. I remember watching Winnie in Latoya’s vlogs before I ever knew she had a big modeling career. That makeup look was flawless
gosh i just love her confidence and everythings shes absolutely b e a u t i f u l like she flaunts her skin so well and makes it look amazing
The sound of the fork in the cup🥴
70℅ of the comment section saying she's cancelled and has a bad attitude but noone bothers to tell us why. lol
Honestly, she's so beautiful
10:35 she legit looks like a giraffe 🦒
The whole makeup is amazing! I just wished you would’ve used a different color on your lips. But you are beautiful nonetheless with or without any makeup!!
She's so pretty I have lost the ability to
Gurrllll you're only there coz of Tyra!  Give credit where credit is due
I love her personality. She seems really centered and mature. These are the vibes!
She is so beautiful thooo
Winnie!! Ur not suppose to use a metal utensils to apply it gets rid of the healing properties of the acv & clay! I use all the same products for my face mask
Positive sun ☀️ 🤗
u would be more gorgeous if u had a nice personality sis , what a shame 😔
It is a very beautiful vitiligo, look like a flower around her lips and nose
Female michael❣️
Sis, whoever laid this lace did dat!
I love her skin it’s so pretty
I love you, Winnie Harlow. ❤️❤️🥰❤️❤️ Truly One God has loved you very much before you were born. ❤️❤️🥰❤️❤️ Honesty, you are still beautiful. I love it. 🤟🙆🏻‍♀️
You're pretty ❤️
Her foundation is too orange. She has beautiful skin, and a very pretty face bone structure.
uma pessoa maravilhosa! ❤
1:00 i kinda didn’t expect that...
10:26 you’re welcome
She’s gorgeous 😧
She "bakes" around the mouth - where's no make up/ foundation on. And the "signature lip " only lip liner and gloss? I meaaan gurrrrl! Lol This sounds like a hate comment but it's not ment to be.
If only her personality was as pretty as her <3
OMG she is so beautiful 😍
A Gorgeous human being!😍😍
めええええっちゃ綺麗😭😭😭💓💓💓💓💓💓💓
5:20 I see I see, quick promo👀👀
Shes the one that shaded Tyra after Tyra gave her, her big shot. Shes problematic af and I'm out
Winnie we love You....stay amazing
You’re so beautiful
I came here to see how she puts her foundation 🙊😹😹
I was wondering why so many people use eye drops when doing their makeup ... is it to make the white of their eyes more prominent??? I never thought that was a thing
thank you vogue for this beauty content. im so bored and tired of all the problematic gurus on youtube
Representing Jamaica well🇯🇲!!!
You are gorgeous! I love Your mouth,eyes and hair.
Metal utensils deactivates aztec mask. STOP USING METAL.
Gorgeous Girl ❤️
العربي لايك 😍⁦☹️⁩⁦❤️
HER LIPS LOOK SOOO AMAZING😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
She is so pretty ❤️
You are so gorgeous girl!And I think you know it.You rock everything you put on!😍😍😍❤❤💘💘💞💕♀️♀️Power!My  great grandma was named Winnie !
without her skin condition she would be just like any average ig iNflUenCer
She is so pretty ❤️
She's pretty even though she had vitiligo ❤️
She’s gorgeous 🥰
Inspiring ❤️
Lol talks about ANTM as “quite a learning experience”. She had beef with every person on the show
口周りが白いからリップの色が際立ってて素敵だね
I thought you shouldn't use metal when mixing your clay? Love the video BTW!
Her eyebrows are AMAZING, love them
she’s so beautiful
Felt awkward watching this. Like she is trying hard to be nice and all good, but like all the comments here we shall never forget how shady and ungrateful she was with Tyra. Never bite the hands of those who helped you, girl. Sorry for the hate. Ugh. 😏
I love how she used the fork to put on her mask 🦋
I have vitiligo I really admire her and I love how she applies her make up on her eyelids. Such a queen
Wonderful confidence🙌🏼
anyone who commented they love her personality or is a fan of her most likely have never seen her on antm. she's pretty alright but she has the worst attitude and personality, i can't stand her.
she is SO beautiful bye
Why is she so perfect 🥵😭♥️
Hm..using the clay with a metal fork defeats the purpose. It literally says do not use metal but I guess if it works...
She’s so beautiful
It’s bothering me that she’s calling her own palette “times” when the “x” in collabs usually implies “and” 💀 “Kim kardashian TIMES Winnie” like its an equation lol
she is beautiful without makeup and with makeup 👍
It is funny, my grandpa and aunt both have vitiligo, I always knew this skin situation and it simply didnt shook me when I heard about you, it is so normal to me. I guess it's only about being used to it, and thanks to you Winnie, people learn and hopefully open their mind about vitiligo
Omg you are just so beautiful! X
Freaking beautiful 😍😍
She’s cancelled . Her attitude towards antm and Tyra was disgusting.
16:55 «честно»
She's so pretty😍
美人！！！
n her lips..I CANT!!! SHE HAS A PERFECT LIPS😻
Takes pride in being POC and wanted to do journalism. Also fat shamed others and talks trash about other beautiful black women 🙄
I actually just want to see her in one colour. Like I'm not hating her skin right. Just curious how she'd look. Like in both pale and the other shade.♥️
I don’t see what everyone else is, she’s been a joy to watch!
She is so beautiful I’m shook
I'm watching the video because I have vitiligo too 💓 and think that persons like Winnie helps to another people (like me) to accept many complex about our bodies.
I cringed so hard when she used a mettalic spoon with aztec..
Her voice is so calmingggg I love it
Sis, you're perfect. I just need to know where you got your hair bc that frontal DOES NOT EXIST!!!!
The most unusual faced girl uses the most normal makeup! Stunning, gorgeous, humble and inspiring <3
I think whenever I’m stressed I seem to break out
her fingers though 💞
She is literally so gorgeous
Dear Winnie,
Omg your lips perfect guuuuuus🙂😍omg
She is stunning 😍
She’s so pretty
Gorgeous ❤️❤️
Gorgeous Queen 👸🏾
Lol she’s determined to not give ANTM any credit smh
Her lips and nose are so perfect 😩😍
This look kills 😩😍😍😍🔥
Hermosa❤
You’re so gorgeous
She finally give tyra a credit uwu
She is so so so beautiful 😍
She said little shoelace brows 😂😂
she's so beautiful
I don't wear makeup, but this was nice to watch.
i love her and her hair so beauty
Omfg I use the same clay mask and ACV!
😍😍 Gorgeous!
What happened to his skin i am curious🤔
Just because someone acts less than pleasant for ONE moment in their life does not make them an ugly person forever... it makes them an imperfect person. . Tyra Banks has had plenty of ugly moments in her career, but all of you side with her because she ran the show and has more money.  Nobody knows what she's been through and everyone has the right to be upset and bitter sometimes ...
She’s gorgeous
Gorgeous! 🤩
Omg she is the most beautiful girl in the world 😍😍
Omggg her lips r everything o my godddd
the metal fork with the aztec clay mask is giving me anxiety . IYKYK
She's so gorgeous and cute and sweet
Your skin is so beautiful 😍
I am seeing her first time and shocked looking at her face and hands!
سبحان الله كيف بشرتها
I see no problem for her covering her vitiligo, i mean we covered our blemishes, dark spots and dark patches on our faces with makeup so if some people are going to complain because she covered her vitiligo then I don’t think people should also cover their pimples and dark spots etc with makeup. Let her live!!! Gosh people are so judgmental. Before you judge someone you better check yourself first no one is perfect 🤦‍♀️
Interesting, she doesnt need lipstick. Beautiful lips. 
she’s just so beautiful like what
This was so lovely to watch
She was so rude on antm
Everyone watch Winnie Harlowe being rude for 10 minutes on YouTube looll
フェイスマスクの材料、全部アイハーブで買えるからやってみるかなぁ
her voice is so soothing to me omg idk why it just makes me feel so peaceful
She looks just like my big sister!!!😍😀
I came here to confirm for one more time how hypocrites are people...for her all the comments are good and she's beautiful but for Michael Jackson who also had vitiligo but chose to put makeup and even the color of his skin people are judging him and telling all these lies about him and laugh at him. Hypocrisy to the maximum.
I think we take makeup too seriously. It’s supposed to be fun
I had no clue she was culturally Jamaican. I like her a little bit more now. 😄
YOUR SO PRETTYYYY❤️❤️
she's so beautiful
We are using the same mask❤️❤️✨
Everybody in the comment section are shading her but I'm just wondering why she calls the yellow shade orange
she's so beautiful 💕🎇
wahhh, nama aku juga winny, seneng bangett
She's very pretty tho💁💕💕
What a BEAUTIFUL woman! ♥️👸🏻
I wonder if she knows you’re not supposed to use metal with that mask
Orange and purple such a new look.. Loved it! I wouldn't have paired them.. It turned out awesome! I'm going to try it, thank you!
Honestly her vitiligo is so pretty!
Nice look! Congrats. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
This lace is very ExSpEnSiVe
I never thought your eye skin looks like that without makeup
Quero legenda :(
Ela é incrivel!
와~~이언니모델분은내가우연치않게6년전인테넷보구알았던거같은데 멋진모델분대단하신분들었는데👍👍👍👍
“The waistline cya wuk”
Whyyyyyy vogue. She’s gorgeous but her personality is such a turn off. No thanks.
I got to know Winnie through Latoya forevers' Vlog, who else?
Winnie is wonderful! ♥️
I love hij <3
You are soooo cute and so nice x I honestly aspire to be as confident and inspiring as you x
DO NOT REGULARLY PUT EYE DROPS  IN YOUR EYES FOR REDNESS.   IT WILL LEAD TO LONG-TERM REDNESS.   NO EYE DOCTOR WOULD APPROVE OF EYE DROPS TO TAKE AWAY REDNESS REGULARLY.  DO NOT THIS.   PLEASE.
She is a complete Beauty Queen!!!!!❤️❤️❤️
美女脸上摸的好像抹茶冰淇淋
Ok, but her skin is just amazing. 👀
This video is so chill I love it.
Can I say *She is one of the most strongest female model in Victoria Secret*?
BEAUTUFULLL.😍
I have the same condition called VITILIGO. It lowered my self esteem.
Love love love love love her so much.
1:00 wait
i was like “why does this video have so much dislikes” 
สู้ๆค่ะ ✌🤟💓🇹🇭🇹🇭
Beautiful with or without makeup I love it !
Кто из Россия лайк❤️🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
you are so pretty !! u slay girlll !!
i thought ur suppose to use non-metallic things when dealing with bentonite clay... something about the negative, positive electrons/ions idk
Linda❤️
Your Beautiful ❤
I was just listening to her and this byeee reminded me of Liza koshy
You're an amazing woman
Personally think she’s overrated and has a sour personality, having vitiligo just covers up her personality because she’s seen as inspirational but there’s other models with vitiligo with less problematic behaviour.
Omg her makeup is sooooooooo nice but she’s so perfect she doesn’t need it I wish I was like that
She issssss very beautiful really! The unic don like me was in the way she made her lips :(her natiral color is beauty
"I'm the trophy of the game, everybody tryna win me
This was actually good.
Metal deactivates the clay for the Aztec Healing Clay. Says on the back of the label.
Она такая афигенная🔥😍
눈 안에 넣은거 뭐에요?
美しいです
どっちの色にもせずに隠さずありのままでいるあなたは本当に美しい。
Still ugly on the inside though. Can't fix that with make up or a mask.
Le femme la plus belle du monde 😍ma sha allah🤲🏽❤️
اكو عرب بلطياره🥳🤷🏻‍♀️❤️🇺🇸Look My Loovy😂🦋🇸🇦❤️
U r so beautiful❤
love that half her products are drugstore. she can def afford all the high end up but sis obv isn’t gna overpay where she doesn’t have to 👍🏼
Really, Vogue? This was the best you could get?
ياناس جمالها جمالها جمالها 😭🖤.
So beautiful!
Wait isn’t this the girl who picked arguments with ppl on ANTM?! Omggggg
Anybody could list the moisturizers się uses? Thanks!
She’s has probably the softest lips I’ve ever seen
We need Zendaya !
i love her, my favourite model ever
i wish i was as pretty as her 🤧😔
ARE WE GONNA TALK ABOUT HER AMAZING ENERGY OR WHAT
Will she die soon?
I love watching videos such as these that educate everyone on their skin. Our skin is so beautiful and it’s so important to take care of it. If anyone is in the market for beauty and natural skin care I am a beauty consultant for beauty counter. Below is the link if you would like to look through the products and take a skin quiz🥰
Loving her!  How cool she's
Wow she's stunning!
Winnie, always remember
I love her personality and yet I see people dragging her, for what exactly I wonder
yaaaady! omg didnt know you're Jamaican. ratings tun up
I love her personality. Great video
this was satisfying af to watch
You can tell she’s not a nice person she’s faking it
BEAUTIFUL!!!!
You look like a fashion person and have your own character.😳😍
Don’t use a metal spoon with this mask because it ruins it
She knows this can be healed right?
I'm not gonna lie. I was curious about how you did the foundation but didn't fast forward. You are so soothing and nice that I watched the whole thing. Thank you for sharing!
The lumify drops give me a migraine!
I need to see this look in a different lighting. I don’t know about you guys but I thought the finished look was harder to see with that bright white background to the left. The lighting was slightly off and I couldn’t tell if I liked the lighting. 😭
Remember to keep comments respectful and follow our community guidelines thank u ☝🏻
Wow , she has pretty beautiful lip 💋😍
she comes off very cocky to me no thanks ill pass
Muito linda parabéns💕😍
الحمد لله الذي شافانا وعافانا مما ابتلى به غيرنا 
voces podiam colocar opção de legenda em português.....
肌キレイ！！
her own lip color is amazing😍
アメリカン・ネクスト・トップモデルで最後まで勝ち残った人だ…！！
Why your skin is like that
Amo um sincerão ❤️❤️❤️
Trop belle 😭❤️❤️❤️🥳
She's ao beautiful 😭
Her brows are amazing
綺麗！
Avoiding mirror alot. I guess this is  how people see me.
I can't stop watching her lips, they're so adorable healthy and pinkie !!
Thank U,

You are so pretty god bless you love you ❤️❤️🤗🤗😘😘😘☺️☺️
Çok tuaf yarı beyaz yarı siyah ve hoş görünüyor👍🏻🥰👍🏻
Can someone please tell me y y'all are hating on her cause I'm soo confused
Over 40's probably couldn't get away with that many layers of product under the eyes. Such a rare beauty! 😍
Her cleanser did the tings!!
I'm not gonna lie. I was curious about how you did the foundation but didn't fast forward. You are so soothing and nice that I watched the whole thing. Thank you for sharing!
She is so gorgeous😃
I thought she was cancelled?
Ammmaaaaazzzing!
Winnie is definitely a go getter. She knew all along that she needed the Kardashian’s klan to get herself a bigger audience/platform, this idea didn’t come like that! That’s her master plan. She been d*** riding the klan for a long time now to befriend with them. I can’t blame her tho. Those people been doing this with a lot of NBA players and rappers 🤷🏾‍♀️
This video is the first that use a nivea products! 😍 thanks!!!! We don't all use expensive products!
Your lips.... I just watched them for whole video
SHE IS SOOOO PRETTY I CAN'T
This is beauty.
She is pretty asf💛😍
BEAUTIFUL STRONG WOMAN
girl idc how pretty u are or unique. if u got bad personality, UR UGLY AF. sorry not sorry
Perfect woman
when mixing Aztec clay mask either with water or apple cider vinegar, any metals shouldn't be used.
I literally love her personality so much
Wow she is beautiful
Can’t really watch her without thinking about Tyra, so ungrateful! Bring Tyra for us not this thing.
omg i love your lips TvT
Then there's me covering my vitiligo and getting treatments to reduce it (free because of the NHS). It's amazing she's so confident with it, but for me I got vitiligo quite late, I was so used to living my life without it when I look in the mirror it's like a different face that I don't even identify with
I actually liked Winnie in ANTM she had her moments but I think she was just insecure at that time and felt left out.
I love how simple she is
MOOOO!!!
YAAAAS QUEEN
I like sooomuch this girl!
She's so beautiful without and with makeup
I just wanna see how she does her foundation
ANTM. 🤷
Can I get Susan Yara to react to this, please??
I am Korean You are very pretty ❣️
Beautiful skin💗
If y’all watched ANTM, you KNOW how bad Winnie’s attitude is.
You are so beautiful.💞
I wanna Japanese ver come out soon!
All I gotta say is wow wowowow wow. ❤️❤️😍
Sus labios hermosos ❤❤
Meryl Streep next please 😭. I have been begging, and also 73 questions with her
Maravilhosa 😍😍😍
Ini mamaknya sapi apa gimana sih :(
Zendaya plssssss
Oh my god I wish I looked like herrr
did it bother anyone else that she didn't know that her own pallet is called "KKW by Winnie" not "KKW times Winnie" lmaoooo how could you go through that entire process and no one tell you
I finally found out how americans pronounce Nivea...it was not what I expected at all! 
Her lips are so beautiful 🥰🥰🥰🥰
You are so beautiful :)💙💙💙.
She's so good.
Why bring up ANTM if you are going to shade Tyra and the show
SHE IS SO BEAUTIFUL!
MARAVILHOSA💖😍
I LOVE YOU❤💋😍👌🏻U ARE THE BEST
Omg you are so so SO BEAUTIFUL😘😍😍😍😍😍❤❤❤
She is very pretty but without vitiligo I don't think she would've arrived where she is. Moreover she is kind of a bully, I'm amazed by how much appearance can be  deceiving . It's useless being pretty outside if you're rotten to the core...
she looks humble and pretty 🥰
Yeah... you’re not supposed to use a metal implement with that face mask, it messes with the properties... I usually use a plastic spoon and then apply it with a flat foundation brush
so beautiful 😍
MARAVILHOSAAA 😍😍😍🌈
No, please don't use a metal utensil with the Aztec Clay mask. 😓 That reduces the effectiveness of the mask.
And the fork has her winning the "Beauty Secrets" best facial tool ever!
that lipcombo is a masterpiece
such a Cutie, much love!
HER LIPS UGH  U R PERFECTION HUNNY
Wait hold up! She really did that used a fork for her mask and a metal one.
The colorization of her Vitiligo reminds me of marble.
she is just so beautiful.
her lips look so good as in the look of it
She is very pretty i love the fact that she accept her self as she is she don t cover her vitillego i love that realy bravoooooooo
Why people couldn’t be like positive when Michael Jackson was here he also had vitiligo.
what yall need 10:34
Omg this girl more prettier than me when I do my makeup
Yoooo! Who needs a make up artist
where's Phoebe Tonkin on those things? pls
If it isn't the 'self-made' model. Would she had been in this Vogue video if ANTM hadn't given her exposure so many years back?
I have vitiligo on my left arm and I actually like it
OMG!!!!
كم انتي جميله ❤️🌠
HOW BEAUTIFUL IS SHEEEE WOW
why does everyone seem to have a problem with her lol what did she do to yall
She is so pretty help me
You should do one with huda beauty
I like the vitiligo ♥️
YOU ARE GORGEOUS OMG
What I've heard about her: 80% terrible personality (I've seen receipts) 20% unique looking. Conclusion: You can be gorgeous and one of a kind but how you treat people will say A LOT about you...
Eu assisto esses vídeos mas sem entender nada que elas fala 😂
There’s so much pressure not to cover up the vitiligo
Please have Nicola Peltz do one 
الله اشفیک
メイクってすげえ
That hair is incredible. JESUS lol
この人嫌われてるんやっけ？w
is it just me who think that she has wig on? i mean i love her so much, she is so beautiful, amazing woman but i just noticed...
Stop trying to make Winnie Harlow a thing.
wow she so beautiful.🧚🌹✨🌠☄️☄️
i thought she was doing a foundation look . the mask was only in the middle  lool
You are sooooo beautiful winne!! loooveee uu 😘😘😘😘😍😍❤❤
Desde el inicio no pude dejar de ver sus labios son hermosos 😱

Honey, you are STUNNING!!!!!!

When she was putting the mask with fork 😳😱😵 like nooooooo
Maravilhosaaaaaa
Beautiful 😍
I'm happy to hear she likes her bushy brows, she actually looks better with natural bushy brows. I love my bushy brows too never want them arched ever again.
6:52 now i can see the shape of her eyes xd
Why are people talking bout ANTM? She was a teen, people change. Ofcourse I don't know how she really is behind the camera, but you don"t know too.🤷🏼‍♀️
I find her so unlikeable
Willow so pretty 😍
She slayed 😍😍😍

She’s stunning
she beautiful and unique 😊
Njirr gw kira tadi baby fey..
가젤같다
She’s so beautiful but I wish she was beautiful on the inside too
Tip!! Don’t use anything metal to mix the indian healing clay— the ingredients that make your skin “pulsate” will be deactivated when you use metal to mix it 👍🏼
I wanna ask something...is someone who has vitiligo......her/his skin going to be white all over body or it's just half of it?

She has such beautiful lips
Her lips are gorgeous
Elle est très belle et exceptionnel 🌸
The way she talks and her mannerisms = Kylie Jenner. 🙄🤮
Omg she looks so confusing
It must be depressed in heaven all the stuff all over your face
Noooooooo you shouldn't use metal with Aztec and cider. No no 😭
i cannot get over how beautiful you are!
omg I was used to love her so much, but since I saw how mean she is, it was a big NO HONEY
Winnie’s makeup is stunning and she’s absolutely beautiful with or without makeup I enjoyed This tutorial ❤️
Youre not suppose to use metal for the aztec clay 😅
Dang who threw a brick at her?
Wow you so cute 😍
"The waistline can wuk"....
baby! she is a master! what a demonstration of self knowledge
Whoa she really is a beauty
Hiiii, would you mind taking a look at my first video on youtube?? If you have any advices, ill take them!:)))
There should be an acid attack survivor model too.
My queen and forever girl crush Miss Emma Watson please!!!
True beauty.
Next time use a plastic fork for that bentonite clay gorgeous
Cream anti age are all bullshits!!!
Your face is ART! What a beaut!
Sorry but I stopped watching once she mixed Aztec clay with a metal fork...that made to whole mask pointless and leads me to believe I cant trust anything shes saying🤷🏾‍♀️
so pretty 🥺😍😍😍
Bacım maskeyi neden çatalla sürüyorsun, başka bişey bulamadın mı
Maravilhosaaaaa
What's the instrumental in background?
Everyone wants zendaya to do one but I hope she doesn’t cause everyone just complains about the products they’re using and how they’re doing it wrong as if the model doesn’t usually have better skin than the person complaining
is that a wig?
You are gourges😊😍
You are so beautiful 😍😍
He bberfol
everyone in these comments need to chill. ya’ll acting like she kicked ur dad or something. 😂
Every time I wonder when I imagine her with one colour skin... She will glow moree....🥰
I love this channel I have just recently subscribed
You don't need makeup to hide your true self you look beautiful the way you are, different or not.
Those eye drops she used are great if your a stoner too
She is an average beautiful girl but became a famous model because of vitiligo.
shes gorg, but this makeup look was most def not it
so beautiful maybe i am crying
I love u so mush Winnie❤❤❤
She is so cute 😊
sorry this ain’t it, she’s beautiful but so rotten! she’s fat-shamed women, makes fun of modes with natural hair, and had beef with everyone on ANTM! INCLUDING TYRA! 😬
She is so pretty
Please do zendaya and madison beer ❤️❤️
she is so pretty
how can a person be that PERFECT. she is even more beautiful without makeup like how
OMG after the mask and the toner the difference is so noticiable, never underestimate your skin products 👏👏👏
I have this disease at my mouth but why a lot like you when I see you really feel confident .. and also follow BTS for this I have confidence myself thanks to them
WHO WATCHED HER ON AMERICAS TOP MODEL!!ME
omg her lips look at her lips!!!
At 15:10 I actually thought she finished..O-O
The metal fork is defeating the purpose of the Aztec clay mask.
❤linda
This lace 😍😍😍
She's soo pretty
Her at 13 looks better than most adults. Like wtf how😭
I have the disease too but not too much and I'm so happy to see someone embracing it
she is SO BEAUTIFUL
I don't care what anyone says I love her she's amazing♥︎
Camilla Cabello makeup please!! how long should we wait for it 😄
She is so pretty. 
Özel bir tursun masallah
she is so pretty
Which Lashes she used they are very beautiful? 😍
when she was doing her skin care my mind was screaming YOU FORGOT THE NECK
It came to the time where people are aware of what vitiligo is. Because I remember when michael jackson said he has vitiligo, people thought that there's no such thing as that and they don't believe him.

I wonder how she'd look like if she's all white and vice versa
No sense of the whole video,if there is no foundation ....
Okay, but how about being grateful to Tyra! 🤭 You should try it too! ❤
Dam! those lips are the bomb.
Algeen que able en español
what lashes sis!!
so pretty
I still remember when an antm photographer called her “panda” shady ;(
зашла сюда чтобы посмотреть как она наносит тоналку
My goodness she really does makeup really well. I wasnt a fan of the lip color with this eye look. But my goodness that foundation is on point. even her brows are amazing. The palette does seem nice. I kinda would like to see her do other palettes. Thanks Vogue
Beautiful 😍😍
Your beautiful
Metal fork??? 🥴
Makyajsız çok daha güzelsin...
what foundation and concealer did she use?
Dope. She could easily use make-up to cover her vitiligo but she rocks it w/ confidence. She must be such an inspiration to others w/ vitiligo
You need to be very self-confident to succeed in this very superficial world...
She is so beautyful
nice i like it
Que maravilhosa😍
😍😍hermosa 😍😍
For those people's who judge her because of the reality in the past, every cycle was fake and of course the production ask to the contestants to act and create drama in the show to boost the rating, no big deal duh...
Her lips r such a nice shape and look so healthy I’m jealousssss
Winnie's overrated. Someone had to represent a previously overlooked group but if she didn't have vitiligo people wouldn't be fawning over her and she's not even a nice person.
So beautiful 🥰
Wow!! Those lips!! U are sooo pretty!!
Shes so rude
She's a queen
U r beautiful🌸
What eye drops are they ? Anyone know?
Her vitiligo is so symmetrical (?) 
Ah..Yes . All great soldiers know that the best way to prepare for war is to rub useless powders and vinegar on their face. #happyveteransday
So cute and beautiful 😍💖💝
唇綺麗過ぎ。
You are so Beautiful💕💕💕
I dont knw y but i dont like her anymore... I just feel she is bitter with her words.. Which is not good!
she is so pretty
So much beautyfull 🤩🥰
beautiful !!
Much power to her !!!
what an actually icon
Wait, is she using a met fork for her clay mask? Girrrrl
Still beautiful
Ah you so prrety woah ❤😻
vogue. That background music was soooo relaxing 🥰
Is that a metal fork? For the aztec mask???!!!
"As you can see, I spend all my time at the drug store"
she is so pretty
Hi. See u on other channels
Guys do we have to be so rude towards her personality? Why us woman have to be so cruel to other woman? Like bruh she seems chill calm ur self’s lmao
Your face , and personality scream Supermodel!
LANA DEL REY PLEASEEEEEEEE
Your so pretty
Wow! Beautiful  😍😍😍😍
You're not supposed to use a metal spoon when using the Aztec clay mask
FORK SCRAPING INTENSIFIES
they should do melanie martinez
I love her sooo much
U r so beautiful
The fact she had to explain why she was covering her eyelids is probably cause people are to sensitive and would probably give her backlash.The people who would give her backlash probably don’t even have Vitiligo
she is sooooooo pretty
what was the first eye drop she used?
Deusaaaaa😍
i love her so much
She is soooo pretty naturally and her skin is amazing
She is really so cute
Why does she put her mask on with a fork lol
With a fork make a mask? My mom its do it xd
isn't visine eye drops?
Anyone else’s eyes start watering when she was putting the drops in 
Her lips care routine plz.
Zendayaaaaaaa
اكو عرب بلطيارة
She is very pretty !
- Tyra Banks
She is perfec 😻💗👑
Wow! you look so cool💞💞I love your skin
she has beautiful hands
She so cute 😄
Tyra DID give you your start hunny.
You are  really self confident and perfect women.
Visine, sis? Really tho? 🤦🏼‍♀️There are soooooo many things you can use to dull redness that are actually good for the skin 🙄
So would eye drops help rosacea ?
my sister also has vitiligo 😘
“How can one be this beautiful?”
This video make me feel like a racist(sorry btw)
She’s literally the biggest example of BEAUTY WITH NO BRAIN
Lipstick was that good
Where is Zendaya???
"you have to protect yurself, no matter what job you're in"
What foundation did she use
her putting on the mask with a fork is a whole new energy
❤️
Anaaam dügünümde bu kadar makyajı anca yaparım
I used to be inspired by her but now i just find her fake:/
She is ungrateful and shady!!!
Am confused
omg she’s sooo beautiful
OMGGggg
She is literally so beautiful in every way possible, so unique and stunning, you truly are such an amazing creation 😍😍😍❤️
love vid.
Camila Cabello PLEASEEEE
Your soo pretty
I love your skin ♥️
15:29 She’s literally wearing a wig 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️ 
ZENDAYA NEXT PLEASE
How u got those eyebrows
Ahh the metal fork makes me cringe
Our body is our canvas A way to express our inner selfs 
Она такая красивая😍 похожа на корову 😍😂
BEAUTIFUL
i like her open warm smile and eyes
you are so adorable  and beautiful
I cant stop looking at your lips!!! How I wish mine is like that too. Love you Winnie!!💕💕
Your lip color is so so so beautiful
Ok i get the love your own skin advocacy going on here BUT CANT YOU USE FOUNDATION TO EVEN OUT UR FACE
OMG you are beautiful
she is so pretty it's not fair for the rest of us 😩
Everybody in these comments quick to judge a person first impression is not always the best.. whether u like her or not she still unbothered, booked and busy..🤷🏿‍♀️
Are you talking about hair damage?! Girl you're wearing a wig!! just buy another one l
Também queremos legenda em português 🥺🥺😒😒😩😩😩
I hate it because she spend more of her time for speaking and not to do her makeup really well.
She is so funny ♡
i love the way those things on her skin form a design it looks sooo ugh beautiful
I feel like people overglorify her 😬
Lol at the visine on the skin
her lips are gorgeous
I am wondering what shade of foundation is she using.
Alot of the people commenting on her personality are just commenting because others are. Where is your own individual thought process? Okay she may or may not have said somethings that don't sit well with others. But dang, let the girl breathe . She is human. Y"all act like y"all haven't said things that may not have been in the best judgement. You live and you learn. You all act like you all know her personally. You don't know what her personality is like....geesh . I liked the video tho.
YO WTF HAPPENED TO HER SKIN LOL
Đẹp quá
on the back of that mask it specifically says not to mix the mask with a metal utensil because the vinegar eats at the metal.. but you do you
Use this button as she’s pretty!
I like how when she put the foundation on she didn't cover her pigment skin on her face!!
Where’s Latoya forever in the comments!?
اكو عرب بالطيارة 😄
She looks so exotic, naturally. Like a lioness. It's impressive :)
she used a metal fork to mix the aztec clay mask!!!! gurl no
She’s so beautiful wow 😍😍😍
It's not "what was I thinking" that was the style back then and there is nothing wrong with it. everybody always trying to keep up with media sometimes its just so sad, note to self, be yourself.
"This is simply not true. Bentonite clay contains salts that create an ionic charge when dissolved in water, but metal has no effect on this" - Allure. Shut up, please.
I always wondered what was her feeling after America’s next top model and I got my answer she wanted to stop modelling! It’s sad to see that this experience made her want to stop instead of motivating her but god had a plan for her and I’m glad she continued that path
You skin make up very hurt
“times winnie” IM HOWLING🤣🤣😭😭😭
U so pretty omygash
she have beautiful lips
Beauteful 😍😍😍😍😍
She is sooooo pretty
Whoever reads this...
مافي عرب هنا؟
Zendaya next please
Her lips tho 😍😍😍
Whats happend With the face???
Finally a real entire makeup ! Not only some mascara and blush because "I AlrEaDy hAvE a nAtuRal bEautY"
Ariana next!!
I mean whatever it is. She earned it 👌 even tho she was discovered by someone and had some issues but let's talk about the aftermath, she worked hard for all her shows and probably that's why she is behind the lens and we all are commenting down here! She is pretty.
her cupid’s bow is so pretty
Her lips is gorgeous.
Imagine waiting for her to get ready to go out on the town....
Why do I see Whitney Houston in her?
OMG AZTEC AND AC VINEGAR SHOULDN'T HAVE CONTACT WITH METAL. PLS TAKE CARE
She is super skinny yet she has a great smooth skin
pretty
‘boots in london is my fave’ girl same, i go everyday. it needs more recognition
she looks like Australian cow ... i love her
So hot 💞 !
❤🤗
So beautiful💜🌸
I am not a big makeup person, but I enjoy watching others get creative with doing their makeup!
I am so jealous of your lips
الله يشاافيج بجاه القرآن الكريم، 💔💔❤️

So 👏 mf 👏 beautiful 👏
❤❤❤
Super beautiful make up

She’s so beautiful.

I saw her first in America's Next Top model. But I guess she changed her name. Its good to see her shine after that. She even made it to Victoria Secret fashion show
next vogue we need queen nicki Minaj please please please 🙏❤
какая красивая)
Casually applys face mask with a fork 😂👌🏼👌🏼🤘🏻
Giống chó đốm thế

Listen to me...she is a whole queen like wow

You are beautiful 😘
No importa el vitíligo ella es la mujer más hermosa del mundo
That metal fork for the aztec is making me cringe!
She seems like she has let fame go to her head and everyone else is 💩 on her shoe!
the metal fork deactivates the bentonite clay
what becca concealer was it
She curled her hair half way through
dont use a metal fork
nobody: 
Wow her lips💍💗😢
PLSSSS ANY1 WHO KNOWS WHAT SHE WEARS FOR BAKING STUFF???
STUNNER!!!!
Invisible toner.
You’re beautiful 💕 it takes a lot of strength to accept all our imperfections. God bless you
😍
Her facial structure is crazy
Just pure beauty
So antm really didn't do that much for her career then
Wow I hate her after hearing she said something bad about Tyra
ure not supposed to use metal spoons/forks when using apple cider vinegar.
She's actually not that pretty it's funny how people only like her because she has the skin condition
I love her lips
Real beauty
