how to cook the perfect rice
I don't think Gordon Ramsay knows what a rice cooker is.
he looks like he has to pee really bad.
Babe...
Italian chefs will tell you never put oil in with the pasta. pasta dishes are always finished in the sauce and if the pasta's coated with oil, then the sauce cannot be absorbed by the pasta and it won't have any flavor.
I came here after I watched his show “the f” word where he murdered the knife😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Why does Gordon move like he just smoked some meth
You can tell by his body language how excited he is to talk about cooking. It truly is his passion.
That was not a perfect rice. It's too soggy. Every Asian knows that
Gordon Ramsay look like someone who urgently wants to pee but can’t find any restrooms.
It gave me anxiety when he didn’t stick his finger into the rice to check if the amount of water is perfect.
"Cut the root and you will cry."
Chef GORDON is the type of guy that in his childhood his parents had to hide the olive oil instead of the cookies.
HOW TO COOK THE BEST RICE: Use a rice cooker
You know you're Asian if you died a little inside when he cooked that rice.
Now I'm starting to think I might have been boiling water the wrong way this whole time.

Wait so the reason we cry from onions is because they bleed?
Me: *gets an ad of Gordon Ramsay before watching the video*

I let the knife do the work. It just laid there on the counter. Didn't do a thing.

Dear Gordon, let cook pasta who really can 😉
Apparently for the thousandth time in these comments: You don't put oil in pasta water! In the best case, the pasta is at the bottom, the oil is on top, they greet each other from afar and nothing happens. In the worst case, the oil actually meets the pasta, and closes its rough surface. The resulting pasta won't take up the sauce as good as without the oil. Your dish will not taste as good. To keep the pasta from sticking together, there is this very secret trick: Stir it around after putting it into the water, stupid! Also, for Italian taste Gordon didn't put enough salt into the water. It's supposed to taste like sea water. For 100g of pasta use 10g of salt and 1l of water. You can get away with less water but then you need to be more careful and stir a bit more to prevent the pasta from sticking together.
Me: filet 
I was getting a ad about Gordon Ramsey when im watching a movie about Gordon Ramsey
How to kill someone by Gordon Ramsey:
Did he said "get the f*ckin skin" when he was skinning that salmon
Gordon: seasons water to cook pasta
Chef, I've been watching you since I was 9 and I'm 24 now and didn't know how much you would impact my life from that time. I just now realized that I had not subscribed. 
1:26 Ricin! Key ingredient, really adds to the flavor.
Gordon Ramsay is the type to season his milk for his cereal
I've seen him do fish in person, it's just ridiculous.
0:16 Damn Gordon, didn't know you were that kinky
4:57 "who's your daddy" lmao

Gordon Ramsey's Cookin' on Crack
my eyes started watering watching him cut an onion....
hears slapping sounds outside
Thank you, Gordon Ramsay, for reviving the "cooking class" form of cooking show. This is long overdue.
Onion must be pronounced like "Onyo" 😃
Sometimes I wonder if Gordon Ramsay is even human. Amazing :O
I love this chef Gordon Ramsay. I’m Portuguese , if someone give the opportunity to spend a day with Gordon Ramsay or Cristiano Ronaldo I definitely will choose Chef Ramsay ...is my idol
me before watching this video: i can hardly fry an egg
The trick to not tear up cutting onions is to not form a emotional attachment.
Not to be rude but filipino got great skill for cooking rice after all we love our rice 
he makes me feel so anxious just to watch him...
esse cara da camera e desanimador!
I do not even cook or anything, but these videos are interesting to me
Me: sees Gordon make omelette 
I just did this an hour ago. It was delicious.
ty Mr. Ramsay this has helped me a lot
He is like bob ross but he cooks instead of painting
🇧🇷 muito bom 👏👏👏
I get scared and start holding my breath when i see Gordon sharpen his knife so dang fast like that.
just like the perfect snake skin hisses 
When you live in the philippines but you still watch the rice part
"Perfectly cooked rice"
There is a lot different to cook/steam rice.
I LOVE YOU GORDON RAMSEY BUT GOD PLEASE JUST USE A RICE COOKER NEXT TIME.
How to cook the perfect rice! Come to my house; I'm Puerto Rican...we don't even measure...we know by the heaviness of the spoon with the rice/water mixture; techniques that only one can learn from mom!
What type of rice did he say?
It's funny that there's always these "pro chefs" in the comments who know better than someone who has 16 michilin stars. It's always: "My granmother has cooked something for me in a different way, so that is obviously better!!!!"
6:22 I'm Italian and that hurt
Holy shit I’ve done that onion trick exactly like that since I was young
he hops around excited the same way when i found out i was gonna touch my first tit
Great video, Gordon. I enjoyed it and learned a lot about cooking and being a chef. But It feels so weird seeing you happy and not furious while cursing at  someone.😂 Cheers from Florida.
When he isn't shouting I could listen to this man talk for hours his passion and knowledge are inspiring.
1:55 MY FILIPINO EYEEESSS!!!!! THEY'RE BURNING!!!
Me encantaría verlo cocinando el arroz económico que todos compramos en México.
creme fraiche in scrambled eggs, and star anise in rice, I'm learning so much
Tip 6. Add just a little bit of olive oil
5:10 Teaching you how to stab someone
Sensai Ramsey explains it so beautifully. I appreciate his efforts to help us learn. Good man.
I don’t want to be near this guy with a knife
Oh my god look how he have done with those fish!😱(Amazing)
This... is basically a filleted... side... of salmon. It's been taken off the bone, and now...
When the water is on it definitely intensifies.......
Stop saying Ricin. Makes you sound like some dodgy russian defector. :D
Wow he knows how to chop a f... Unions.
ow Gordon, watching him cooking for a long time now.
I thought he said "400 grains of rice", got so worried 😂
Wow... these are some great simple tips, thank you for sharing your passion in life with all.
I have this amazing ability to not cry while cutting onions.
2:45 "DO NOT LIFT THAT LID" literally three seconds later "Lid off" hahaha
being a white man, this is essential A1 skills for me.
additionally to these points I also curse and swear like Gordon at the ingredients before and during the cooking procedure. It works like magic.
Thank you for this video. I'm learning to cook💪☺
5:00 not sure I trust gordon Ramsay anymore since he says "sharpening your knife" he's simply bryne rod to correct the knifes edge, not actually sharpening the knife just making the edge straight again.
"Nice, long, stroke."
gordon ramsay: I will teach you how to cook rice-
Love how he accentuates the verbs every time.
Looks like he's busting for a wee the whole time
Oook.. I gotta say it.
Eu gosto do arroz parbolizado nunca empelota.
Brilliant! I've finally decided to pursue my passion. I need all the help I can get. Gordon, you are my HERO!
I’d learn a lot quicker if Gordon was next to me yelling at me and insulting my cooking skills
It's been 4 days my knife is at work so long
The perfect man doesnt exi..
Thank you, Mr. Ramsay, these tipps make my cooking a lot easier.
I really appreciate they way he takes his time and is fast at the same time on making his food. Keep up the good work Gordon
1:  Salt
David504: Gordon Ramsay what are you doing? Smh 6:22
3:30
That guy stole my grandma's tactic.
there is an invention that called 'electric rice-cooker'. Works for me.
me just being born:
also when you sharpen you knife like that, always clean it before cutting food. there are a lot of microscopic parts of steel after sharpening
Cooking pasta perfectly, "Olive oil in." 
HOW can you CHOP

Thank you for this video. So many helpful tips to save us from the types of chefs you're used to working with ha
I just want to see Jamie Oliver do his style under Gordon Ramsey's supervision.
Was the camera man drunk or something?
7:02 “al dente” hahahah thank you gordon
Jeez after being someone who only knows how to make instant noodles my mom was sure impressed after showing her the skills i learnt from this video :)
Can someone please explain why I was crying when he was cutting the onion I’m so confused
The skin on the salmon personally is my favourite part
He slapped that salmon on the table with the might of ZEUS
Exelente chef saludos desde mexico
I managed to light a bowl of cereal on fire every time I tried to cook. :l It's my bad luck, haha!
6:36 he spreadin them pasta like a deck of playing cards
Just realized how hungry I am
1:12 like si crees que el mejor arroz es el danubio... (solo para los que entiendan ) aguantee ese arroz hervido con huevo duro...
He’s good.
Im asian, i know that rice is damn cooked well
3:20
Can you teach me how to make an Idiot sandwich?
Not even a single tear with that onion......... this is not a man, this is a robot!!
Oil in the pasta when boiling? 😱 Gordon, you've disappointed me!
Very cool to see Ramsey using techniques that I have taught myself through many years of cooking for friends and family.
Salt in pasta water isn't just about flavour: it's also about osmosis and not making it flabby
idk y i was scared he was goin to yell at me the whole time
I Like Gordon Ramsay but He has no idea how to Filet a fish or how to Sharp a knife
its sad that such a good chef have to suffer with a camera that is mounted on a rabid clown and  music that is drowning his words
Me: Please Gordon no I have a family don't do this
I just need my finger to measure the water needed for the rice.
So basically, add olive oil, salt, and pepper to everything you cook.
I can really make perfect rice than him
Today is oct. 21, 2019.. 😂😂
Beautiful pasta al dentei😂😂😂😂😂es el mejor un crack
I can't cook a lick but there's something about Gordon that convinces me I can😂😂
Why does Gordon always look like he got to pee?
That faucet has the most perfect stream
Hermosa clase de cocina de mi chef favorito😍
King of the Rice is Sinandomeng
I've been cutting my onions wrong for yrs, 😁, i got it now
I must have misheard at 1:20, I added 400g of Ricin.  The rice was delicious but now me and my family are dead.
Alright, I realized I’m not a bad cooker, is just that my knives are really bad
"Let the knife do the work". Well thanks, now I don't need to learn to do anything
I love to watch your episodes on national Geographic 🌸
For some reason me seeing the onion makes me wanna cry...
I watch this stuff and get excited about making it. Then I make ramen noodles
Chef! Let cook pasta to Italian’s chef...
I learned this years and years ago before Gordon ever decided to make a video on it. I mean its really common sense on how to finely dice an onion with just a knife.
Ojalá que hubiera más youtubers como tú. Muchas gracias por compartir tus conocimientos. Ya tienes una suscripción más.
These are great tips! I will try these in my cooking.
Who else keeps on saying 
You can tell he enjoys this
Thanks Gordon for kick starting my love for cooking. I didn't know how cathartic an home cooked meal could be. Thanks Chef.
Thanks for sharing Gordon!  Us bachelor's will hopefully eat more healthy! I love it when you share these simple things Gordon, again THX!
I’m Gordon when I gotta take pee really bad but need to finish the tasks!
His stripper name is Fluffy Rice.
Love it straight to the point and excellent techniques i like your knife!
10pm: I should start learning for the test of tomorrow
3:50 PULL
the way he slapped the fish on the  cutting board lmaoo  3:30
oil in the water, leave the pasta to Cannavacciuolo, with love an Italian
He loves cooking madly, he cooks so so so so seriously
He needed to pee when he cooked the pasta
That sound of the fillet slapping the counter😁
Esse parece que sempre usa cocaína
For those of you who don't have a scale, 2 cups of water, one cup of rice! I like to use a pot with a clear lid so I can watch it boil, then turn it down to simmer and see when it's done.
Wohoo.. I learned a lots from Chef Gordon spaecially cooking of Basmati rice. I cooked mine perfectly as I copied the measurements. But I add more tricks of mine I cooked Yellow Basmati Rice not mushy.. I got 50 views for 8 Hours 😀✌🏽
Gordon always moving around like he got to pee really bad😂
I never add olive oil to my pasta water. I want my sauce to stick to the pasta. When you oil it, the pasta doesn't still well but to each his/her own.
Gordan Ramsey join the group on Facebook its called : Good ole soul food
I've been pronouncing pasta wrong this entire time. It's "Pahsta"
[١١:١١ م، ٢٠١٩/١١/٣] اسرو: Restaurants Bakery & Pastry Shops
The way he just throws the fish
Find his cooking skill extremely good!
I like it when the rice sticks together
did gordon just taught me how to cook rice?!
did gordon just taught me how to cook rice?!
What am I doing here? I'm 14 and the only thing I've ever made is instant ramen
Seeing the thumbnail, I thought for sure that chef Ramsey would teach us the proper way to chop off fingers.
Thanks for making this video! Make more like these!
Damn! Gordon is so expressive!
I really can't handle how he says pasta
also it's very important to tell the rice how stupid he is. The humiliation is the main part of cooking.  Just Gordon Ramsay thing
Usually when i file my salmon i start with the same cut but then i take the backside of my knife while i hold the tail and then drag the backside of my knife along with the skin and let meat come off the skin. I think i save a lot of the lovley salmon meat  by doing it that way
When the thumbnail is a thumb nail
I'm learning to cook and British English language at the same time as well! I love it Gordon accent.
First , do some blow. And then grab an onion.
I love all the videos but why does it always look like he's rushing and desperate to finish🖤🖤💖🖤🧡💗💞❣💓
Seriously!!! WHO DOESN’T LOVE YOU!!!
Here in Philippines even a kid can cook a perfect fluffy rice.
Here in Philippines even a kid can cook a perfect fluffy rice.
I really hope that salmon skin wasn't thrown away.
I don't even know how to cook anything and Gordon made me watch the whole video
This onion tutorial is fantastic.  Thank you!  Haven't cried since.  :D
Ramsey is proof cocaine is a hellava drug....I learned alot from this hyper guy
“Beautiful”

hmmm imma learn to cook with these skills let's do this.
This is so satisfying to watch .
I’ve been cooking since last year and I’m 13. I cook for my family a lot and whenever I’m in the kitchen I’m happy. Thanks for teaching us to not open the water works while chopping an onion. Now I can make spaghetti sauce in peace
He cant cook.🔥
As a university student adjusting to living alone, thank you Gordon
Great tip on tweezers! Never saw that before!
He seasons his rice O-O..
Why is this man so fidgety?! OMG! LOL!! Watching him bounce around everywhere is the most entertaining part.....aside from consistently slamming that fish down on the counter. LOL!!
Just noticed he’s got his shirt inside out lol
someone kill this camera man so Gordon can put it on a tripod
cooking rice - so once the lid goes on just listen for it to boil and then when it does turn it down to about 2 on the dial for 8 - 10 minutes?
This is the only video that I've watched Gordon Ramsey not swearing.. 10/10
Did anyone else eyes almost tear up bc it saw an artificial onion lol
@0:15 - I can't believe this isn't pointed out yet.  LOL!
Remember,Don’t cut the root. 
Mm imagine frying that skin and serving it on the side
Thanks Gordon! Now I feel like I'm a top chef
Pero por qué le quiere sacar el almidón? Necesito el almidón, carajo, necesito mis carbohidratos
Perfectly cooked rice? 🤷🏻‍♀️
omg just go to the bathroom.
This is delicious!)
I love it, cooking is a wonderful art.
I always love your cooking, but man, that's not the way you cook pasta.
he should do a guide how to screen at people when they cook wrong 
Does he film all his videos on a full bladder?
Ramsay is actually a good teacher too 👌
Here in the Philippines! we love the dukot in rice HAHAHA
#1 it's pronounced NE-NOOOO!!!
you make it look so easy, but wit practice, patience I know i can do it, I look to cook and love all kind of seasonings
The way he jumps around makes me so anxious
The rice seems to be half cook.

I've seen your tv shows sir I'm scared to subscribe but I love your cooking videos
un maestro :D
Always grip from behind, use nice long strokes. 
I always feel bad when onions bleed, it's why I cry.
Gordon Ramsay: eats his own rice "The rice is bland"
You must warn us no to watch these wonderful videos while you just get back home from work. I almost ate my phone when I saw the rice...
Thank you Gordon I've been doing it all wrong
My perfect rice:
Step 1: Find the lamb sauce
0:15 " Three fingers, 1 in front, 2 behind" ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
I can tell you've done that before Gordon
I’ve been making rice like this for many many years, it does smell much better than plain rice.
"cut your fingers"
Go
When you watch this video knowing damn well you don’t even step a foot in the kitchen.
One Italian has died for each tablespoon of oil added to that water pan hahahahaha
1:25 ricin?! You tryin to poison me Gordon?
I Will become like you. You are my dream!!
Think i need atleast another hour explanation on cutting onions else my finger goes as well xD
"Do not lift that lid off"
Gordon's technique in cooking perfect rice is amazing would use it everytime.
Gordon:“Cold water, always”
for that rice isn't cook yet, 😃
Thank you!
Smack that fish on the counter.
he's going to fast, need to play video at half speed
Just made rice like the recipe and blin, it was good.
The olive oil also sticks to the pasta a little when you drain it giving it a nice flavour. I saw an Italian cook saying that the oil stops the sauce sticking to the pasta but I've never had that issue.
Really cool way to chop onions Thanks for the advice
As an Asian I'm like, who the hell cooks rice without a rice cooker?
Where's the beeping?
He be jumpin around like hes on speed
God I love that man
high energy and quick to the point. I just watched a different cooking video and it was so boring
He either really has to pee or just did a bunch of coke.
Italians will laugh at you when you put Olive oil on a boiling water.
Gordon:  Don’t cut the root
How long have you been on Master chef Mr Ramsay
I wonder how many acid tablets he takes with his concentrated coffee?
Nice tips, but the camera-man is drunk apparently.
When he says 8-10 minutes he means 9
Amazing!
What in the damn hell is the camera man doing
This just changed my life lol
I didn’t know you needed fighting skills to work in a kitchen.
Learned from the best on Hell’s Kitchen! Ramsey your brilliant!
The subtitles are confused lol
Cooking really is an art form and this man is a master at it.  I just wish I had a tenth of his skills.
You rinse the talc not the starch :)
"Do NOT lift that lid up"
My knives are arse. Makes me sad.
Thank you!
Hi Gordon, I would like to thank you so much and say how helpful this was to me. Ever since I was a child I lost my ability to smell (which also affected most of my ability to taste), but I still cook for family. I just had a surgery a few years ago that has help regain just a little bit of my ability to smell and taste and I have found out how terrible it is to cut onions! Before my surgery I could cut onions any way I wanted to, but now I can’t! Thank you so much on the onion cutting tip! It’s helped so much with joining the world of smellers!
Yeah nah dude that ain’t how you cook rice
How To Cook Rice:

It depends on the type of rice.
Вот ведь гад!
Doesn’t use his finger as measurement for rice? 😶

日本語版の説明が欲しいよ😭
Preparation is done, mental is done. Now, is the time to challenge my mom

It's RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAW!!
He’s always so excited like he never stands still he’s always jumping about 😂😂
Thank You for being You Chef
❤
I love your energy man
I admire Gordon, because he’s full of life
4:56 "One nice fillet of salmon... beautiful"
Gordon: pAsta
I miss working with you gordon
Thanks Mr Ramsay!
Beautiful süper 👏👏👏👏
"How to cook perfect rice"
Gordon, teach us how to make the “riced cauliflower” taste like real rice...great tips, love your help!
NOOO OIL IN THE PASSTAAAAAA
He really should cut back on his liquid intake before filming these....
Yea that rice ain't perfectly cooked...
As an Asian, cooking rice like that is strange
"Let the Knife do the work"
ffs, there's no need for olive oil in the cooking pasta water. At all.
Watch Filipono how to debone fish faster :)
And you don't even know what does "al dente" mean, you don't know it at all
I need Gordon in the kitchen with me yelling at me, I need that in my life.
Who else is reading the comments while watching the video at the same time ?
Gordon jumps around like he has to use the bathroom
Hi
I have been cooking for three kids grandkids for years I never knew don't cut that eye off thanks for that tip I love your cooking shows any new ones coming
❤
The knife part looks scary... Rice was easier
Thank you Chef Ramsay.
He moves and bounces around a lot like he's a tweaker lol
Great tips!
I find the salmon skin is delicious if so salt it really well and fry the fish in oil. Then it's nice and crispy and salty. Also the skin on let's you cook it skin side down most of the way without the fish burning
He does not know how to cook rice 🤣
i make pasta alot Thank you Chef!
Cheff Ramsay looks good pin sharpening a knife. Like a true predator, sadistic. He can slice you meet clean from the bone, rz
is anyone here for the actual tips?
Very nice, amazing how many forget and fail to keep refreshed on the "Basics" & "Foundations", we are in a generation of young and others wanting things over-night and that is not the way things work, it takes time. Thank you Chef Ramsay for this video and your consistent encouragement!! and wisdom.
He is very energetic  person .with straight though  so we love him
Another great video , Thank you Ramsay !
wow how much coke does this guy snort weekly?
"Just a Table Spoon of Olive Oil in the pasta"
Trust me you dont need that salt in the rice.
El rabito de la cebolla es lo primero que yo le corto 😨
Awwww did the mean onion make you cry? lol
A table spoon olive oil, then pour a cup
I like to imagine immediately after this video, he ran outside and did six laps around his house.
Ideally you should us a salmon slicer knife for skinning salmon. ;)
My Asian ass will just throw rice into the rice cooker
He always seems like he has to pee really bad, but never just goes to toilet.
He is cooking Basmati rice 😍
As an Asian, I think it is so strange to cook rice like this
im gonna go ahead and say it, you made your knife more dull and also probably damaged the edge when you were banging the edge into the steel
Pwede ba yung pancit canton? HAHAHAHAHA
Gordon mándame un saludo e encanta tu energía 😘
Wow so this is the vid where 80gumsdrop took the words out
Official sponsors of Gordon Ramsay : salt & pepper
Let the knife so the work
Thats not a perfectly cooked rice
Ahora ya se cocinarme pasta y arroz 👌 GRACIAS 🥺
This is the moment when you feel stupid cause how does Ramsey is genial.
Stop moving the camera
Why I feel the cooking video is kind of exaggerate🤣. Definitely a good cooking show rather than a cooking tutorial.
Can't wait to have rice, salmon and pasta again for dinner!
One thing I wish he would have covered with the pasta is the heat level.  I've seen far too many folks lower the heat to a low which turns the pasta into mush.
Gotta disagree on the pasta cooking.  While oil may prevent pasta sticking together, it also prevents the sauce from adhering to the pasta (unless you're using an oil based sauce, which most people don't)
I disagree with you oil in the noodles. Now you're going to get greasy lips!
That rice was still wet though.
the way he cooked pasata made me cringe so hard. And then he called it "angel pasta al dentey"
Is anyone was Shocked about the Flexible Knife??
Showing the salmon who is the boss by smacking it around. Next, he'll pee on it to show dominance.
Forever a Legend
Woo.... it so amazing ! I hungery now seems like difference country difference foods so far many country.I ever watch channel "cook ing with little brother" those guy help to show type of food so much about their country , If you want to know just check it out!
Why’s there so much people from like 2-3 weeks ago? Are we all that dumb and we can’t cook? Or is this entertainment?????
Muy buenos tus sus concejos  gracias  un saludo de colombia para usted 💁
"3 fingers, one in front, two behind." I use the same technique Ramsay boi
#ничегонепоняла 
i let my pasta melt and now there is soup in my pot
Or put pandan leaves when cooking rice. Heheheheheh! And a splash of vinegar to make the rice last longer.
When you see a comment that you could’ve used to get likes but everyone took your ideas :(
Um... The rice looks wet and raw.
When Gordon explains he's always dancing
Thank you chef
Cameraman needs to watch a How to Master 5 Basic Camera Skills video.
3 fingers, 1 in front and 2 behind.  Haha
The fish part was a very sexual experience.
😂 Asians watching Gordon cook rice be like: >:( (breathe, don't attack-
Bueno ya aprendí a afilar cuchillos de manera profesional, ahora me toca comprar todas esas herramientas, porque corta mas mi lengua venenosa que los cuchillos de mi casa...

Nice tips. I regret not watching this man sooner.

WEBADAS AQUI EN PERU GORDON RAMSEY ES UN AMATEUR
Still can't quite get my rice to mirror Gordon's. 100g rice, 150ml.. It's drying off to soon with lid on pot.
me and my family put onion and garlic in the rice and soak it for 10 minutes before cooking :)
i cant wait to gently caress, and slam a raw fish fillet on a cutting board like Gordon Ramsay does. Then, call it beautiful. Splat!
Stop hopping round!
As an asian... that rice seems like blasphemy...
4:58 when someone says shreck is ugly
He puts the oil in the water before cooking the pasta?
he's hopping around like he is in a boxing match or something
Gordon I have a question Do you have the lamb sauce?
Ok - My question is how did you peel the onion without cutting it first???
Its like he cooks a 2 hour meal in 5 minutes. Dash of olive oil... And done. 😂😂
What a phenomenal entrepreneur this Gordon is?
"Three fingers. Two in the front, one in the back".
1:25 Ricin ? No thanks.
why sometime we have recipe but we still can't cook good food like the person who teach us??? Like if we have all the recipe, ingredient, and method to cook.
Thanks Gordon i learn alot from you
This video Gordon says to use nice big pan for pasta cause it gives sufficient room for it to cook.
Ramsey: DO NOT LIFT THAT LID UP
Nice long stroke. Interesting. Go on
I can easily and quickly (tho not Gordon Ramsay quick) get the vertical cuts in the onion, as thin or thick as I want.  
My perfect rice requires onions and garlic.
Aunque usted no lo sabe eres mi Maestro en la cocina. Gracias por compartir. Maestro.😍👍👍🤝💎
Just like a perfect snake skin... Sssss
He could cut artichokes and Brussels sprouts nicely, and I will eat them raw with pleasure, which I originally do not like.
My fav chef .. 🙌
hum and the things you learn something that basic and simple who knew around onions that they cause more eye irritation if the roots are cut of then split
Pasta cooked with olive oil? ITALIA JUST CRIED T.T
I swear his family is so lucky
Thank you Chef.  your passion for cooking is awesome. and I don't get verbally eviscerated when I cock it up.
The way he says pasta lol
Oil in the pasta water...¿?¿
Gordon Ramsey is naturally coked up constantly
Me: I gotta chop onions
No pues el puto arroz no me salió hasta le eche lo que decía. :'v
I loved all of it EXCEPT putting oil in the pasta. If you oil your pasta the sauces will sink to the bottom of the plate. Stirring gently in the beginning of cooking the pasta is sufficient to prevent it from clumping together.
Who else left handed ✋🤔
step 0: own a chef knife.
Chef me encanta ud es el mejor.es hermoso verle cocinar.dios lo bendiga
Nice, I was telling a friend about rice and rising it and the entire group said, YOUR NOT SUPPOSED TO RISE RICE. BUT I WAS RIGHT ....or maybe it depends on which kind of rice?
Gordon didn't cook by himself 
1:10
Oh.Mr .Chef Gordon.
Dear Chef Ramsey, what do you say to those who feel that you should never add oil to the pasta because the sauce will not stick to the pasta, I know you are an expert, please explain your position and share your knowledge
I would like to join a Five Fruits cooking competition to learn cooking
I feel like a professional watching this
starts crying rapidly sounds like me lol
♡
The minute of the lamb sauce recipe???
Love you CHEF 😘😘 😘😘 😘😘 😘
Instructions unclear
He teaches better than my 'professional teacher'
When cooking the Pasta Do not pit Oil in the water It will prevent the Sauce from being absorbed by the Pasta.
Gordon's shirt on the salmon one is worn the wrong way
This is so intense
I absolutely feel like cooking after watching this video
Oil in water for a non-sticking pasta? Are you kidding, mr. Ramsay?)
His “snack” smile at 4:25 thou 😍
I got an ad about Gordon Ramsey
I love Ramsay but that’s not perfect rice.... QUEDÓ AMOGOLLAO’...
Every Italian chef I have ever seen says NO oil in pot when cooking pasta.
Gordon seasoning the rice scares me
Ease up on the coke before the next video
In Brasil, first we fry the rice with onions, garlic, oil and salt before before cook it in water...
Why does he always bounce around like he's on uppers?
Never saw my grandmother put olive oil in the water. She'd probably kick my ass if I do.
Gordon having a wank:
✌️thanks
Put in the key turn it let the car do the work
I was taught to use roiling boiling hot hot water then add the rice, hmmmm. My rice comes out perfect. I will try cold next time and see what I get; looks like he is using basmati?
bish if ur asian u’ll know the trick of cooking rice much easier
Yeah mr. Ramsey! Yeah SCIENCE!
Wish everyone a good day.
i love this man, he changed my life, but...don't sharpen your knifes like he does, you'll ruin them.
"Like a perfect snake skin... sssss"
So basically listen to ur mother when she teaches you how to cook
How to cook perfect water?
I wish I could be on masterchef for a fillet challenge. I regularly fillet pike.
Do you know of any food  that are great for October?
Does he have to pee or has he done a couple lines of coke?
Did anyone realise that he changed his shirt every time he does somthing new 😂😂
What should I let do the work when I sharpen my knives? The knife or the steel? Please help.
Rice in, not to be confused with ricin.  :]
To cook great rice, you need an asian mother and they can make it without any pods and no soggy ness
Gordon: to test your pasta, lift a strand and taste it
Lessons from the best.
minha mãe faz um arroz melhor...
Does he need to go pee?
It's like 5 basic things I can't do at home...
I love how all of you are saying that this is not knife sharpening or a perfectly cooked rice, yet I am sure that 80 % of you burnt all your food down and then just either made instant ramen or ordered some delivery.
I used to add curcumin, coliander and salt
Usually chefs tell us to not use oil when cooking pastas as it makes the sauce slide away from the pastas
I wouldn’t be surprised if Gordon Ramsey could do surgery too
why this full of ASMRitation?
I've always been told to rinse my freshly sharpened knife. Yet, I always see Ramsay just chop food directly after sharpening.
The roots are literally the first thing I chop off from an onion
Chef Gordon Ramsay You are one of the best
Rice with star anise? 🤢
I always learned to sharpen a knife in the direction it slices.
is he on drugs or what 😮
I am from Assam ,India . Nice to watch your Northeast program that joining cooking competition .. 
When animals start a revolution against humans the chefs will be the first people to get eaten
I think asian people are better on rice than western(?)😂
Why does Gordon dance when he's talking?
What type of rice? I didn't understand him
This guy make me hungry even if he only talks
He ruined that "Fill It"
Anyone else got a Gordon Ramsay ad before the video?
Is walking on the spot and standing on your toes another secret of cooking?
go chop onions for 2 years
Thats not how we cook perfect rice in Philippines.
Wipe or rinse the blade off after sharpening it as you are leaving teeny tiny metal shavings on the edge!
No se yo pero la mayoría de cosas lo hace como mi madre :v. Toda mi vida están cortando mal la cebolla xD
He forgot to season the chopping board.
The cameraman 😅🤮
Gordon you should know that adding oil to the pasta while cooking will later prevent the sauce from sticking to the cooked pasta.
Pasta takes 3 and a half to 4 mintes, not 304 incase you used subtitles xd
Omgosh, nice long strokes!? Its Halloween,  you're allowed to be naughty ! HA!
Taking the bones out of a salmon filet is the most satisfying thing ever, I invite you to try it.
Era que no, once millones!
In the next video Ramsay will teach us how to fry an egg
"basmati rice, the king of all rices" ummm I think not
Stoooppppp saying fileTTT PLSS
Why is jumping like he has to pee
He is like the TUPAC of cooking
I am not cook, but  about sharping knife... By my experience sharpening knife goes against the blade. If you do how Mr. Gordon showed - it will leave barely visible "skirt" on blade. That will cause sharpening knife more often. If you blade goes against sharpener - this "skirt" will not appear. Of course cause have to keep propert angle.
Just what is needed. Could quite happily have a short video for each item as that would make the activity easier to search by.
Great video that I would have really enjoyed if it wasn't for the camera. This was filmed like a space combat on the modern Battlestar Galactica series! :(
4:52 "One nice fillet of salmon, BEAUTIFUL
Murag sa rice lang ko dili mobilib kay Gordon.. Hehehhe
who else skipped the rice part cuz making rice growing up in an Asian family basically means you learn how to cook rice before you learn how to do math.
📲*00212645752301* *Whatapps*📲
I'm not too sure in adding 'Ricin', I'm pretty sure that is highly poisonous.
I appreciate his short, clean nails.
You overcooked the rice
Didn't realise he's left handed!
Teach me daddy
Why he jumps so much.
"Basic Cooking Skills"...
rice is overcooked a bit ?I use 2 parts water and put it on high heat till water evaporates.I then put it one for a further 10 mins for it to steam cook
Dosent olive oil only prevents home made pasta from sticking together?
With almost 24 million views, this guy must be pretty good!
So I can’t stand the sound of sharpening on knifes but I want to be a great chef one day how can I get over this feeling? Or if you can’t tell me tell me some tips instead.
Please, don't do the olive oil in the water thing...Do it later as it's completely useless to add it in the cooking process (It does not mix with water, It hinders the boiling just as the salt, in fact the salt goes after the water has reached boiling temperature), the pasta will stick together only after a bunch of seconds it has been drained, plenty of time to add olive oil. Sources: I swear, every Italian.
Gordon: Cuts the onions
Rice looked a lil mushy in the pot. Looked better on the fork when he picked it up. Also, I thought rice was 1 part rice and 2 parts water? I've always made mine like 1 cup of rice and 2 cups water. Turns out perfect every time. Love the perfect steak though. Def learned something new!
Muy buenos consejos para principiantes, exelente
Ramsay,cant you speak
why is Ramsey doing the peepee dance?
You just gonna chop an onion and not shed a tear??
Come on, oil in boiling water...
He really should use the washroom before filming.
Im from, india.Mizoram...
Gordon, my wish is to just have a kitchen as big as yours.
Si me sale con un arroz así en mi cocina lo mando sacando por inútil.
Di marunong magsaing
🙏
🙋
Is he really related to Golden Ramsay
How to grill lettuce?
That filet knife 🔪 is sharrrrpppp
And let the knife do the work
Oh Gordon, you're not a snake. 
He may be an awesome chef but has no clue on sharpening a knife 🔪
If you soak the rice for 20-40 mins, rinse and then cook you'll be amazed with the results!
no oil in the pasta go take another snort.
I dont think they zoomed in enough
He has a scale for rice? I'm sure that's not all he uses it for ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
lugaw naman ung kanin
The rice looked more on the wet side.. Persian rice is where it’s at
gordon ramsay not standing still for 7:40
我們煮飯不需要電子秤有根中指就可以了
What in hell is wrong with the cameraman?
No way... opposite to Chinesse rice Style.
One most  basic thing of all. NEVER FORGET TO SEASON
All great tips.  But OMG, he put  "oil"  in the pasta water (and a lot of it)!  and salt,  and not only that, he put oil again on the pasta after he took it out of the water(?) and he added more salt(?)! -  No need for oil at any stage. Unless, of course, you are doing Olio and Alio pasta (Oil and Garlic pasta).
to cook rice you need: your finger, rice cooker, rice and water
"Just like a perfect snake skin, ssssssss." -Gordon Ramsey 2016
why the heck is he using telescope for recording!!!
Why this guy is always so agressive? 😔
Here in the ph, we can cook rice without measuring tools for water and rice. only my fingers is enough. lmao
wow super recipe and delicious👍👍👍thanks for your sharing with us👌😄😄！
2:23 holy shit, zoom in more, I could almost see the water molecules
wow thanks gordan but i want to cry
I believe the key to Gordon's success is the cute bouncy dance,I bet he plays tennis👍Thanks for great videos your a superb chef indeed⚘
How to cook perfect rice using Pinoy method: "Use a finger"
Te quiero mucho gordon ramzay❤
Can he get in my kitchen and make me a sandwich
Basmati king of the rices? 😅
Is it weird how the ad is also about Gordon
if you chew gum while chopping onion you will not cry
its 3:30am and here i am watching this video
For everyone commenting on the way Gordon Ramsay was cooking rice, just stop. We cook rice in our own different ways. Different rice is cooked differently. As a Chinese, rice is a staple. I have jasmine white rice, mixed with pearl rice and brown rice and I don't measure my water or how long I wash it for. I just wash it till it's clear, add water till I myself feel it's enough and then cook it till I feel it's perfect. So if Gordon Ramsay feels like cooking Basmati rice with star anise and pepper, then it's his own version of a perfect rice. You can cook rice with coconut milk or make sushi rice or biryani rice, it's your own decisions so yeah. Stop commenting that it's not perfect because we all have our own ways to make our version of a perfect rice. Thanks.
It kinda weird seasoning rice with Vietnamese
People on the comment section telling Gordon how to cook, whilst they can't even cook an egg.
RinsE ThE RIcE, bs you get some rice and some water and put it in the rice cooker asians have
He doesnt rinse the knife after sharpening it?
I never measure the water when cooking rice. I always just use the skin lines from my fingers.
i❤u
So dizzy with da camera 😓
Espectacular!!!!!
That rice still looks wet to me ...
I tried letting my knife do the work but it has not moved an inch after i came back. What am I doing wrong?
Hindi marunong magsaing si Gordon Ramsay
Happily surprised at the lack of curse words. The inflated ego is still there, else I’d think I’d been watching a doppelgänger.
Step one: buy a $500 knife
I can't get enough of Chef Ramsey. I watch kitchen nightmares, hotel hell, and now his cooking shows. I think I'm addicted
The benefits of olive oil in pasta water is a myth!
Looking at how Ramsay cook rice. As south-east Asian he should try making nasi uduk ;)
I am italian and the part about pasta is ridiculous :D it made me laugh so much! 1) you put the salt only AFTER the water is boiling (otherwise it will ruin the pot, and you ll eat more metals I suppose, but the main reason is that, if you add salt AFTERWARDS, you will need less salt and your arteries will thank you: the salt will "stick" superficially to the amids, and it will taste salty as well, with half of the salt. 2) oil in the water to avoid sticking pasta together: It is absurd, and you do not need science, but just basics: oil and water WILL NOT merge together in any case, that means, oil will stay apart and will not help the pasta to get less sticky. I mean: everyone who studied basic physics at school know that. And it is of course experience: if you cook the right amount of time, it will not stick, dot. If you overcook it, it will stick. Dot. No oil secret :D and, as someone already told, oil in the water will only stick on the pasta once it is out of the pot, preventing the sauce to stick to the pasta and the result will be a no-no 3) I am happy he did not break the spaghetti, at least.....
I like knives
Is it uh... weird if I wanna be slapped and thrown around like that salmon? I wouldn't mind if it was Gordon Ramsay...
Why the camera have to shake like having Parkinson's Disease?
Sat nd peppa😜
Te fuiste al pasto ramsay, aceite en el agua de la pasta, en Italia te cuelgan si te ven
Who said this was proper way to cut an onion was like that. We are the cooks not them....
The best.
The camera movement makes me sea sick.
Things that are very rare to find 
Was anyone else eating a delicious stromboli around 5:45 P.M on November 2nd while watching this delicious video?
Why would somebody remove the skin? It tastes delicious
That salmon slap tho
"Beautiful.."
Gordon Ramsay looks like if he has to pee or sumthin
What a fool beginner I am!
We usually eat rice with something so never salt rice otherwise maybe too salty. I usually use rice cooker to cook rice. Easy! I am definitely on the lazy side, I love to eat than cooking.. so much work! Plus wash dishes too
in asia , asian mom just cook the rice without any seasoning
yo chef you lifting?  cuz your arms are jacked.
El arroz perfecto no me convenció mucho eh.....

👌👍
gordon how do i cook the perfect meth
You help me so much thank so much
nice video,but the rice seems to look raw and really damp.In our country,we just wash up the rice(without any seasoning),ratio the water well(using our hand),and let it boil.When it starts pouring out(water),we turn it off.Then minutes(presumably 7) later,we slow cook it to puff up(or in short terms,cook)
Cuales son las semillas que usa para el arroz?
The way you cook that rice is so so wrong.
What if my broke ass doesnt have cardimum and stars? I guess butter salt and pepper will work
Look like he forgot seasoning the pot too...
In asia even little kids can cook rice 😂 not with a rice cooker that it
😘😘😘😘

Just noticed that he's left handed
That rice is overcooked and moist :/
WTF am i watching?
Don't teach Filipino how to cook rice
Finally someone who knows that the steel is used to flatten the burr, not cut an edge.
it looks like he is doing sport,jumping back and forth
Note he did not demonstrate how to peel the onion with the root on it
How can you tell if the sharpness of the knife is adequate?

DO NOT ADD OIL TO THE BOILING WATER
never use olive oil on your pasta if your putting sauce on it
I'm was tiped a golf club membership pin from a Japanese businessman. Some quarter million a year. Love you in these quiet personal chats. I was chip boy in a friend's fish shop aged 12.  A friend 15, in an apprenticeship trained me in knife love. I might, go off,  if I was confronted with knife abuse.  Thank you.
No "3 fingers, one up front, 2 behind" top comment? C'mon YouTube, you're disappointing me...
Ножи править не умеет, пасту готовить не умеет, с рыбой грубовато вышло.
3:32 Just noticed that his shirt is inside out.
Nicely done Gordon. You should go pro as a chef one day.
why doesn't he pee before the videos?
Quella la chiami pasta?Hahahahahah
We don't eat pasta al dente here in Britain do we?
It's like he's constantly on coke or meth while cooking
Awesome
Learn how to use a knife, how to cut food with Chinese chefs, you will learn a lot, Mr. Ramsay. I have a sense that you did. But you are far from mastering it.
Esse arroz tá todo errado. Arroz vai alho e sal. Só! Única coisa certa aí foi a água no fogo alto e  depois abaixar com a panela tapada sempre pra ficar soltinho.
0:28 when she asks what you bring to the table
measures rice to 400g exactly
What is the golden rule in the kitchen that is above every chef is that what matter is the end result and chef ramsay makes it absolutely clear and reaches the pinnacle of prepping the best dishes from start to end..wow..
Apparently, this guy knows nothing about cooking perfect rice...
We cook rice every day in the Philippines. But the rice you make is not already done.. Just saying
Basmati from Punjab,😘😋
his energy is so much & i hope to be this excited about cooking one day. 
https://youtu.be/wgkAuZhH1Dc
That was not a perfect rice.
The rice if over cooked
You cannot use oil on preparation
He’s jumpy and energetic.
fluff it
how do you know when the water has begun to boil if you leave the lid on? Would you hear it or? - A complete novice chef
Thanks
Is this man on Cocaine?
Is slamming the fish on the board necessary 4:57
Is it necessary to smash that salmon into a chopping board? Nice lol poor salmon
The rice was too soggy. Wasn't good. You first have to soak the rice then steam.
Wife: finger me!
Asian  people leave in the chat when   the rice was season
God, I wish it was as easy to skin a fish as he makes it look.
oil in the water to cook pasta? yes, really? cook basmati rice perfect? shure...
As a Brazilian, that rice is just plain weird, even though the spices seems interesting enough to try. Just add olive oil and garlic, it goes with (almost) everything. Also, my mum would kill me if I wasted olive oil to boil water lol. Just use it after the pasta is cooked. Even if you're not making salse, add garlic+oil and it's done.
he is NOT "sharpening a knife" he is straightening the knifes edge on the steel. big difference! you need a stone to sharpen!
byoot-ful
4:55 I laughed so hard when the salmon slapped onto the countertop
I chllange you sooooo much ,. how to make pakora.....
Legal muito bom estou aprendendo muito

What did he throw in the rice?
Shitty camera work
where is the make the knife do the work rule? O.o
Nice share 👍👍👍👍
I think ur a really damn good chef
Can you stop hard throwing that poor Salmon side around??
If the rice takes "8 to 10 minutes" but you are not allowed to take the lid off, how do you know when it's cooked?
