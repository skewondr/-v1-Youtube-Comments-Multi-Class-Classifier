Consider: The 2019 Youtube Rewind is just a white screen that only has the Youtube logo for 10 minutes.

Storm YouTube HQ for 2019 Rewind
Why does everyone think it’s so bad? I’m not saying it’s good, I’m just wondering...
Don't wanna watch the video? Political issues and Fortnite. You're welcome.
I’m going to be honest, the only person who made me smile was Jayden with the audacity to sneak in the chair.
Want to know what this video teaches about: YouTube and many Youtubers don’t actually respect what the viewers actually want. The featured Youtubers tried their best but didn’t succeed.
Let’s give them what they want
Lol 2019 rewind will make this look decent XD

If you are commenting something it’s because you want likes in your comment

In 2019 rewind we need:
Imagine a hacker went on live chat “giraffe” that would be so much better and less dislikes!!
I think swiss001 Should be on the 2019 Rewind C'mon he does best landings!
Pewdiepie, is not only the biggest Youtuber, but we’ve had most of the biggest youtubers coming together and uniting to keep him first subscribed. Arguable one of the times youtubers have been most united together. Pewds doesn’t even get a mention let alone a cameo... nor does Mr Beast...
2019 must be PewDiePie, Minecraft, etc.
90% about how many dislikes 10% weres the youtubers
Youtube did an oopsie 🙊🙊🙊
So this is what happens when you give youtubers the rewind
Cringe...
Did YouTube delete like 5 million dislikes cause I swear there was more
Fortnite is included... 
Roses are red,
I am so proud of all over 16 million people who disliked this video
You know what's more difficult than finding someone you know in this rewind?
Just getting ready for yt rewind 2019
if YouTube had a search history:

2019 Guaranteed to be Old Town Road
For this year's YouTube rewind watch them not feature pewdiepie, jeffree star, shane dawson, and will be like the biggest cash grab of the year. For this one the animations is the only good part of this rewind.
In 2019 Rewind needs more:
1:12 "apparently we control rewind this year"
Who are these people? i didn't spot any of the top 25 youtubers in this!
this is the reason why in the future I will build a Death Star...
Stop giving me the smart a$s comments, I can’t decide what’s good or bad anymore 🤷‍♂️
If Minecraft isn’t in 2019 rewind we are canceling the Area 51 Raid and replacing it with a YouTube raid

You'd think that YouTube would take this into consideration and make their website better, but obviously not. The dislikes are justified, in my opinion.
1:25 This is exactly what this video doesn't need
big thank you to jaiden animations for sneaking pewdiepie’s chair and logo in it, thank you. very cool.
Minecraft and pewd need to be in 2019
WHAT HAPPEND WITH 2019?!?!

I neeley passed away when i sour the dislikes
I hope I’m not jinxing it but I think this years rewind will be a least a little bit better than this pile of garbage
Youtube: exists
Everyone: Most disliked youtube video on youtube by youtube!

We should storm YouTube hq
It is more like the most disliked YouTube video
for 2019 yt rewind, do nothing
Youtube: what do you guys wanna see in 2018's youtube rewind
who's coming to this video just to check the dislikes?
If Felix and Marzia's wedding isn't in YouTube Rewind 2019, we will raid YouTube headquaters instead of Area 51
The only thing that is good in here is the dog part
2019
How brave of them to put this on my recommendations
Why do you hate this guys I wanna know I'm the therapy
“Lets give the people what they want”
Why is this the most disliked video?! Are you guys crazy?! This is so good!
I Hope the rewind of 2019 be better, the 2018 rewind makes so much, so much, SO MUCH cringe
What they thought we wanted: Fortnite
What happened to I wanna be tracer or like:
"we control rewind this year" 
Where’s pewdiepie vs t series
As soon as i heard will say fortnite i disliked and left. Dont even care about the vid
I still dont know who are all those people wtf
On behalf of the YouTube community, I am proud to say that this website is slowly dying of boredom, literally.
You know the drills boys, it didn't start with PewDiePie saying year review
Tell me why u hate this I'm not judging just explain
Am i the only one who only remembers fornite in this video and K pop and not the rest
Did he just say: 𝗮𝗵𝗵𝗵 𝗜𝘁'𝘀 𝗿𝗲𝘄𝗶𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲
I keep coming back to see the dislikes 😂
"If pewds isn't in yt rewind 2019" 
YT SEO: the first 10secs is the most important part of a vid 
It really isnot a rewind. The scenes are random, From the magic school bus then went to the jungle the became K-pop, the am I feeling dance started trending at tiktok.
Only thing I like is the K pop and Cardi B combi
If you had pewdiepie in the video would have much less dislikes!
Anyone remember when Friday and Baby were the most disliked videos
YEAH YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SHOULD READ THE COMMENTS
The credits scene is my favourite
Who else disliked in 2019👇🏻
Coming back to look at the dislikes,  does put a smile on my face!
“Baby” by Justin Bieber: Looks like I’m the most disliked video ytb 
imagine actually giving this video a like
Where is rewind 2019??
I litteraly just came here to unlike this video
Where the hell was pewdiepie, Mr. Beast, Markiplier, Jacksepticeye, and all the actual Huge fan based youtubers That have worked their but off, where are they?
If Minecraft doesn't make it into 2019 YouTube rewind I will plan a second attack on area 51 and take E.T hostage
This Rewind haves more dislikes than likes 😂
The likes from this video are from the people in Australia
Why does this get worse every time I watch it
This is why YouTube is putting 4 ads, to punish us for disliking this
Wait...who are these people?
If next years rewind is this bad or worse then youtube should delete its own channel
I’m really wondering if they give us what they want this year...
YouTubers:*pander about advocating mental health for two minutes*
2019 = free fire
All i wanted was pewdiepie to say year review
YouTube rewind 2019: pewdiepie, Mr Beast,  dude perfect,  minecraft,  mashmellow Is always welcome.  For the love of God,  no matter the love hate relationship with pewds, put him in this year's rewind,  He had an awesome amazing year and he does deserve it,  after this year,  you can go back to hating him but please this year pewdiepie deserves a spot in it. Thank you.
I swear to God they will make everything we liked for this year Cringe
The only reason I like this is because erold is in it oh and dom
The fact that the top comments are so new is crazy
Puts copyrighted music
i hope the 2019 one fails, so we can see an infinitely better one on Pewdiepie's channel, like last year's
2019 MINECRAFT Y FMS ARGENTINA
Wait.. Am I the only one who didn't hate it all?? Like.. What's the reason everyone hates it because I really don't know.
Solo vine a ver los comentarios en inglés

why do people want minecraft in youtube rewind youtube is just gonna make minecraft cringey again.
Theres not even "This is me" from TGS
Pewdiepie needs to be in 2019 and minecraft, memes and the death of fortnite (a line chart of the searches for fortnite going DOWN)
We did it boys! Most disliked video ever! Great job everyone.
Is Lele Pons really going to be in each YouTube Rewind? Maybe it’s because her humor is the same as the creators in this video. The throwback viners created cringe. 
Don't mind me, just checkin' the dislikes
In my opinion this is the most trash YouTube Rewind I ever experienced or listen to.
I want the T-series CEO flossing for 8 minutes this year.
This video is by YouTube and it’s the most disliked video on YouTube 😂😂
If pewds marriage isn't in YouTube rewind 2019, we will throw 115 mil dislikes and a YouTube HQ raid

Justin Bieber: I have the most disliked video in Youtube...
I think the folks over at YouTube take the names of everyone on Earth, draw them out of a hat, and put those people in Rewind.
It Hasn't Even Been A Year Yet And Most Of This Stuff Is Already Outdated
I beg of u , don’t do the rewind for 2020 , or I will literally end myself
I don’t want Minecraft to be in rewind 2019 because it’s gonna make it cringe again, so let’s savor this golden age of Minecraft revival while we can
Plot Twist: The people that were in rewind disliked the video

2018 Rewind: Everyone controls rewind
The only good person in this video was Safiya
The thing I love about the next rewind there can’t be fortnite bEcUz if you haven’t checked the internet or if you don’t know 9nyear olds if ya haven’t noticed fortnite literally died

Idubbz, Filthy Frank, and Pewdiepie for YouTube Rewind 2019. If not, we'll get it to 20 million dislikes.
Who came back in 2019 just to see how many dislikes are on the video.
Rewind: Becomes most disliked video 
I bet almost everyone here came just to see the amount of dislikes.
Nobody is gonna care about this comment 😢

Justin Bieber : I'm the Most disliked Video
Not gonna lie, they had me up until "let’s give the people what they want..." 
"There's one thing this video needs,
I feel bad for all the youtubers who were probably forced to write nice things about rewind in the live chat.
3:33 the animators didn’t have to join rewind. they’re too good for rewind.
“Let’s give the people whatever they want”
I don't know 90% of the people in this rewind?
claps until my mum says stop
I don't know they, who are? WHERE ARE MY FAVORITE YOUTUBERS.
i am confused by the people disliking this video maybe i was the last one disliked this
So like y’all really never gonna put pewdiepie in your vids
Youtube Rewind is now the most disliked video in the world BY YouTube.
Corporations have no idea what normal people like and this is evident 🤣🤣
It aint a rewind until it has pewdiepie songs and ali a meme track opening
I'm surprised that they still didn't delete this POS
Felix & Marzia got married. 
When youtube made itself the most disliked video
In YouTube rewind 2019 I want 2018 YouTube rewind memes

I finally realised why thanos snapped
6:08 you ruined it for me and I'm leaving
I don't even know what to say about this I-
No T series in rewind 2019
YouTube had ONE JOB..
“Y’all we can do whatever we want. What do we do?”
I didn't know that 16M people had 400 IQ.
Pewdiepie rewind is better than this lmao
I remember watching this for the day it came out, and thought, Ummmmmmmmm... what? You wanted to give us what we wanted? And now, I realise maybe we got what we wanted. The trashiest, weirdest, most disliked video on YouTube. That's decent, right?
In the first age, in the first battle, when the shadows first lengthened, one stood. Burned by the embers of Armageddon, his soul blistered by the fires of Hell and tainted beyond ascension, he chose the path of perpetual torment. In his ravenous hatred he found no peace, and with boiling blood he scoured the Umbral Plains seeking vengeance against the dark lords who had wronged him. He wore the crown of the Night Sentinels, and those that tasted the bite of his sword named him, the Doom Slayer.
2 million people hated this so much they turned their phone upside down and disliked it again.
only good part of this vid was the sister squad
This is well made garbage
its beautiful how the most disliked video on youtube is made by youtube themselves
I refuse to believe Casey wanted K-Pop
Excuse me I want Year 👏 Review! 
Hmm smoth editing i like it

Hey who here hates all Women
WoW this is so great! So funny and emotional!!! I truly feel connected to all multi-cultured youtubers and the great mega-corporation that shepherds use peasants! I died at the Baby Shark part! XD Can't wait for YT Rewind 2019!
If we can choose what happens in 2019 rewind can we choose to cancel it?
