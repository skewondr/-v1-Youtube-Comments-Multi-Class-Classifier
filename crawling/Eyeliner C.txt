Check out my NEWEST eyeliner tutorial where I show you guys how to create 12 NEW different eyeliner looks 💕 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNkz2Oeo4Wo
The thing is I can do it perfect on one eye then the other goes completely wrong

0:50 simple eyeliner
People are such haters. How are you going to dislike a make up tutorial? It's so harmless.
All of the eyeliner styles were beautiful.
46 million views Wow ☺keep going 😘
Fab man ... di you are best i don't know how to make eyeliner..  i was watching many many videos but when i saw you i get it.. seriously (not a joke)
I just loved it i got to know the best tips ever and i just wanna thank you so much m also waiting for your more videos
Whenever I'm making a winged liner look I can never make two eyes look same ....😥 I get so pissed off sometimes​
This girl has no eyelashes. Which makes it so much easier.
Her eyes is so pretty and beautiful

Hey, this is good tutorial. I found good product. Universal eyeliner stamp. I have it too, much more easier to make lines on your eyes. Here is shop beautyzy.com/products/eyeliner-stamp . Thank me later. :)
Love your make up tutorials I struggle with eyeliner this has helped a lot. Thank you from Rozaline. Xxx
Am I the only one who applies it in my own style and it turns out looking fine? XD
Thank you, simple, accessible video!
The double winged eyeliner reminded me of the dove bird shape, you know what I’m talking about?
I love how u put the information in simple sentences without intros and blabla. Thanks for the video, most efficient one on youtube. Thumbs up!
You make it look so easy, your amazingly talented
she... she put it on so perfectly. she barely had to use her other hand at all to like, stretch out her eyelid/hold it in place. no tape. no guidelines. she just... put it on. and it looked clean as hell.. D:
Amazing eyeliner styles... My favorite is the classic one.. What's yours. ?😎
Beautiful eyes u have ❤
Good Job ! You DEFINITELY help me out . Now . I can do it MYSELF 👍🤗
Your voice is very sweet 🥰🥰
I love the way I look with eyeliner but it's just so damn hard to apply it since I have very long eyelashes and I can't actually see where I'm putting it D:
This is nice I loved the double wing and this is very helpful to me thanks
This ameizing😻
I'm asian And my eyes are amazing 👀
just subscribed to you , I've just watched couple of your vids and deffo thought you were great
My problem is I can't get both sides even xD
My eyelashes keep getting in the way and if I hold my eye shut it’s hard. What do I do
Hello I'm from Hyderabad you're looking awesome and pretty so good.  I want be put like that can you send me please that items...Eyeliner etc...
To encantada com seus olhos são muito lindos, parabéns vc muita linda perfeita make... 😍😍
You're makeup is beautiful. You obviously have a very steady hand and lovely smooth eyes which make the eyeliner look stunning
i cant even do a straight line 
I loved the double lined
Wow, it's super I love it i may prefer for any marriage and I like ur cat look liner it's amaze me
Really you have so beautiful eyes😍😍
I like your voice.The way you speak is soo good and cute😘
U R Pretty 🥰 Great Tutorial
been doing my eyeliner for the past 11 years and i still get it right... the one i always try to do is the basic n for some reason it never comes out smooth or even so usually i always end up not wearing makeup cuz i think eyeliner its so complicated 😭
Omg I tried one of them and it is the same as the video one
I love all one except smooth
I always plan to do regular liner but end up doing drama ;-;
Ur very cute girl and I also like to make wings in eyes I want to know which eyeliner u had used it is not liquid and it not smudge in eyes 😥
Thank you for this video♥
I never thought our eye resembles  a fish belly
me watching this...oh its easy
You know whats really annoying for me, my eyes are different shapes! If look closely you can see the difference. It makes it impossible for me to do eyeliner
I loved the all looks and I have tried the all..mine favorite was drama,,and winged....
I love it 
Loved it, dearie😍
This was my first eye makeup video n from this i learnt many styles so thanku so much
I don't know why but i always cry when i'm doing this @_@
U r looking nice and beautiful with these eyeliners.😍
Wow...great tips it helpd me in my sister's wedding...
Hey what's the eyeliner called ?- you flashed it away too fast!
Aap bhout cute ho yrr 😍😍😍😍
damn i wish i were a girl so i could try this for once.
Its still difficult especially using my opposite hand that i dont right with
It seems to be easier but not actually
Your eyes are so beautiful.... 😍
Best video on eyeliners!
one side is okay! but getting the other eye to look the same is damn difficult!! anyone else with the same problem??😂
It's too...perfect. .
The hard one is drawing the second eye at the same way
Amazing all look of eye liner thanks for sharing the video
Wow Amazing...so beautiful 
did your eye start bleeding from redoing the eyeliner so much? damn girl that is dedication! xD
Thank you so much this is very helpful for me
Thanks for sharing..❤️❤️❤️
Ty I love all them but I'm going to try cat eye I'm going to a party tomorrow
Hi i loved ur eyeliner vid can u please tell me where your eyeliner brush is from as i want to purchase it. Thanx. Xx
I freaking hate it when I do one eye perfectly and cannot seem to do the other. It makes me want to cry hahaha 😂😂
Ur video is very helpful thank you so much nd u r very beautiful woman luv u🤩🤩😍😍🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Amazing 😍😍
It look easy than using icing eyeliner liquid. I might try the eyeliner that you use.
I'm in thought how much she have to wipe eyeliner for every single style
I can never seem to get both eyes symmetrical :(
ficou perfeito 👏👏👏👏
i m liner lover......... n now fall in love with all the tutorials......... 😘😘😘😘😘👍👍👍👍
It's very good I like it... and it's gonna be very useful thank you
my two eyes the liner gets different shape😣
Love love love <3
its beautifully showed
Gap between ur eyes and eyebrows are amazing
Perfect
It will be perfect if you don't make those cuts in those critical "correcting points" (like in the 2:32 minute) so we can realize how do you transform those rude lines in those perfectly beautiful strokes, Is the part of eye makeup that kills me ToT!!!
I don't have time to do like this hahaha buy I really like it
can i just know the name n size of the brush u used?...can someone tell me pls?
God that urban decay eye primer was used by EVERYONE back in the day lol I wanted it so bad lol.
what eyeliner ate you using? thank you so much for your tutorial your awesome😊😊😊
I hate it when people say like 'Start to wing it out' but when i do it on one eye it looks awesome and then on the other it's crooked and it's infuriating 
I use primer and my eye liner still fades so fast and looks bad really fast. How do I make it stay really black for longer?
Awww sooo beautiful 💜
hi mamm iam giri wife and i  ask some question  who to dra THA PENICLE IEE LINER

what is your liner name plz reply
the double trouble and the fishy tali were the best and the Drama was the worst. Great video ^_^
buetifull
Amazing
Can I get name ap eye-liner
Wow 😯
Why didn't you explain/talk us thru the "drama" liner. That's the only one I was interested in and the only one you didn't tell us how to achieve. 
Wowww
https://youtu.be/mwLCcCHGsdg
That is one good eyeliner she has, it's like a flat brush. I don't think she'd achieve same results with a pencil, and her eye shape is ideal for painting. If she had deep set eyes, again, a different story, she wouldn't be able to do all her designs because they simply wouldn't show once she'd open her eyes.
I love soo much
I love the smooth but for some reason find it really hard to do correctly
How much price

Thank you SO much! I'm not very good at eyeliner, so this was really helpful! I recently started showing my 13 year old daughter how to do a natural makeup look for school and the 3rd one (I think the third one) really helped me show her! I am not very good at explaining things either, so this was very, very helpful! I love your channel and so does my daughter!
Nice job 😇😇😇☺☺
Très jolie et simple j'aime ça

I don't know why but I think I'm gifted to have my eyes/eyelashes/whatever because most people compliment me for saying that I look like I'm wearing eyeliner but I'm actually not. My lashes are thick and long so I don't need mascara either. BTW are you a fan of EXO?
Waoo nice

Nice..but her eye makeup has made her eye area a bit dark..like if u agree
yo I swear idk why so many Asian people find double eyelids to be better than their monolids, I actually wish I had monolids because eyeliner is so much easier to apply
