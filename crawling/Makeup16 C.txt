I love how she gets straight into the video !
I lived with freckles my whole life until I learned to shade my face from the sun.....no thanks.
Tip as you request, bronze the neck and around the ears when we do an updo or pony tail. Contour a lil under the lips just in the center to have a full lip too.
Whenever I think she's done she keeps on adding make up!!!!
"Works for every mascara I have except for benefit rollerlash"
I love shaving my face.. sounds weird but it really changes the makeup
This woman doesnt need makeup. OMG
I've spent my entire life covering up my freckles!
Freckles fade with age😂😂😂 no they get worse with age due to sunlight.
Just have to say I’m 45yrs old and my freckles aren’t going anywhere 😳
I LOVE how you don't use filters in your videos like a lot of other makeup YouTubers. You have real skin, it's naturally beautiful but you do have freckles and pores like humans. It makes me so happy to see real skin and makes me feel like mine is normal. You're a queen 😍
Really amazing ❤️. I like it. Kindly tell me about long shape face contour.
Excellent! No jabbering! Thank you! TIP: my lashes don’t Curl, so I heat the lash curler with a blow dryer and and use the blow dryer to dry them upward.
they all want to look like a kardashian. very sad
Your eyebrows are perfect here 🙌🏼😍
I love that Chloe doesn't use any special blurring filters. We can actually see her pores which isn't such a terrible thing!! Her skin is beautiful.
Wow an MUA who gets to the point within 5 seconds?! I Stan!
1:35 would you please share what eye shadow you used in this video please? I think it makes your eyes look amazing and I'd like to purchase it. Thank you very much.
You're amazing! Thank you so much for making this <3
Damn good stuff Chloe, thanks for this!
Am I the only one who thinks that make up only looks good on camera but totally fake in real life?
ew you're so pretty i dond't even want to do my makeup now.
Thank you so much for these tips. There were quite a few easy tweaks I learned to make things work a lot nicer. 👍👍❣️
Unë e doja shumë përbërjen tuaj! 🥰
Has Elizabeth Arden bronze Lustre eyeshadow been discontinued?? if so what do you use now?
looks good..but i jus dont like d idea of fake freckles..
I love this! keep making content your amazing!
Well whilst watching this i ordered a dermo razor thing and settling spray and also liked and subscribed :) thank you for your tips!!
I love how everything is explained.
her earrings are really pretty!
Chloe is the only honest guru I actually enjoy watching... She's the only one I watch that doesn't over due the face tuning/soft blur effect and keeps it real 100% with her life and videos ❤️❤️ I love you Chlo!!! 😍❤️😍❤️
Imagine shaving your face everyday and after 1 year dark hairs starts growing on your face!
Too much work for me and I feel like I’m wearing a mask. I think you look good without all that stuff.
Great vid sweetie! Also, last time I checked, you paid for those panty liners. So whoever doesn’t like it can change the channel. I’m sorry. You seem like a sweet girl and probably wouldn’t say that to them but if it works for you , who are we to tell u what is wasteful. Trust me. The same ones saying that “it is a waste” and whatever other crap excuse they are giving are the same ones who drive cars and prob do nothing to help the environment. Anyway! You did a great job and thanks for the tips. I am definitely going to use these. Stay sweet precious:)
Lot more authentic and useful✨ thank you so much ❤️you are lovely.
I really wanna do the shaving thing but do the hairs grow back thicker/darker at all? Xx
My hair just moves to the side when I try the pony tail trick
This is the first time i have seen anyone else use a spoolie to remove mascara mistakes. It’s really a genius hack. Even when you smudge on your upper or lower lash line. It always works.
Love everything but the fake freckles. Silly.
She is perfect by spet 8, why adding so much more being so pretty and so young!! Nice video of course ;)
Who else is waiting for a little story time on the hair cut! Omfg
You’re stunning. So beautiful!
Sou muito sua fã!!! Te acompanho há um tempão e minha admiração pelo seu trabalho só aumenta! Adorei o vídeo, parabéns!!!! 
The sudden craze for faux freckles... it's weird, one day you see someone with freckles next day they either migrate across their face or disappear completely😂
omgggggggg i freakin love what you've thought meeeeee .. thanks
4:45 looked so satisfying omg
Lobe LOVE the content! Awesome info, ty. Your definitely a bright ray of sunshine too others. That are looking forward to keeping the best  the best status of looking younger and vibrant skin*
Ummm freckles fade with age...I am 44 I WISH that was true. 🤣
I’m crying....this is so helpful. *goes to turn on notifications.
OMG!!! When your hair is in ponytail you look just like Candice Swanepoel!!
i know your secret... YOU ARE CANDICE SWANEPOEL'S TWIN!!
You said, "shit", that cracked me up!  Great video, BTW. ;)
The eyeshadow you use here is perfect!  since its discontinued, do you have another similar favorite in the bronzy shimmer shade?
Best Beauty Hacks Vid i`ve ever seen! <3
Good tips thank you. Especially the shaving, I have read celebrities do this before walking the Red Carpet! 
It's literally half past three in the morning in Germany...What am I doing with my life? 😂 At least I'm watching one of my favorite youtubers...💁🏽😂
Omg you have the most perfect face😍and thanka for the hacks.🙏
It's perfect! Thank youuuuuuu <3
Thanks you! Love from the netherlands 🤗💖
Ma sei incantevole!!! ❤
I'm so sorry about your hair Chloe - that guy deserves every rude comment he gets. Use castor oil - it'll grow back. We love you x
These are awesome and presented awesomely. .....new subbie 🙌
love that eyeshadow .. and of course it's discontinued!!  😤
Amazing, really helpful. Thank you so much.
I spent thousands of dollars on laser treatments to get my freckles removed. Now freckles are back in style!!! I can't win for losing !!!
Loved all the tips (except for the freckles). :-) 👍👍👍
Thanks for the tips Chloe! 💋
Love these hacks Beauty! Genius 🙌🏼
"tease the SHIT out of it" was the best part 🤣💯👍
When you have a ponytail, you have to take a little bit Make up or powder behind your ears ... otherwise you have white skin behind your ears
Make sure to blend your makeup on the side of your neck and the exposed skin behind your ear when wearing your ponytail. Thanks for the great hacks!!!!
❤️❤️ amei
Tem rosto lindo!
Love it! I am so lame when it comes to doing my own make-up, and I'm going to try to put all together like you
Omg!  Wish I discovered your channel sooner!!  So glad this popped up in my recommendeds!  Thank you so much for these awesome tips!  Especially love the lip tricks! 🙏🏻❤️💋🤩🤗
Wow. Great tips. Thank you! But with such a naturally beautiful face, Chloe Morello, it's so easy for you to put these tips into practice. And yes, thanks for getting straight to the point of the video right off the bat!
Tks for the ponytail hack!:)
This is the easiest yet beautiful makeup tutorial I've watched.. I'm in love with this
Chloeeeee! I FREAKING LOVE YOU 😘 mwah
Great vid. Thanks for the tips. Loved them all except the freckles. Don’t think it’s prettier or more natural. Loved ur skin before the dots. :). 
I love this vid .. i can't do eyeliner properly ..help me out here 😁
Thanks for this video. You're beautiful. You are italian like my mom.
perfekt ! ❤️
A tip my eyedoctor told me is to always close your eyes when applying powder around your eyes, this doesent really benefit the make up but getting powder in your eyes can clog up your tear channels and cause permanent eye damage 😬
The eyeshadow, is there a replacement for elizabeth arden bronze lustre? I love it!!
Setting sprays usually contain alcohol and other questionable ingredients, I stay away from them.
Omg your eyebrows are AMAZING!
You're simply gorgeous and i enjoyed the video. Thank You!
Chloe! I love you and Sebastian! You guys are gonna be so happy together! I love you, thank you so much for being you and inspiring people like me every day!
So awesome, thank you so much!
Adding freckles?  LOL.  I've spend my whole life trying to hide mine.  Funny.
You’re so beautiful. I really like your eyes, look like angelina jollie
You are just beautiful! You also have great beauty tips. Thank you 😊
Absolutely beautiful and I love all the tips! All are so doable for anyone! I am a makeup artist and still love to watch the videos...I must say this one just popped up while I was looking at something else..and I am glad I watched it!

Girl your foundation is too orange! Apart from that love watching your videos!
Thanks sooooo much for the tips!  Can you tell me where you bought your earrings please?
Lovely 😍
i just realised that i've been doing most of those, but i got there myself)) like the setting pray on sponge and wet sponge powder)
Perfect 👌💕
you look gorgeous girl, but shaving your face is heavily advised against. it leaves your skin susceptible to even more bacteria without a layer of protection. it causes skin to wrinkle, dry out and look waxy.
Favolous ❤️
Great video! Thank you so much for sharing. I’m definitely buying a white eyeliner now. New subbie!
Great beauty hacks for a natural look and a very pretty woman with good ideas. Probably pretty with or without makeup.
WHERE DID YOU GET YOUR EARRINGS!!! I MUST KNOW!! haha thanks <3
use a thin layer of translucent powder before the foundation makes the matte finish last longer and will look fresh without cracking or sweatin without having to retouch
Love the hacks!  Love the video! Your gorgeous and your makeup is remarkable!
WoW! Very interesting. If I ever wear makeup these tips WILL be followed!
The spoli idea is a good idea. Great tips love it ❤️

Why have I not seen these tips before.
Would love to know which lashes you are wearing in the video. Thanks for the tips!
@3:59 YOUR EYES ARE BEAUTIFUL
Hi there what a great video!! i have a perfect Idea for the hairline or the white spots on the head which appear through pulling the hair straight and tight back into ponytails. Just grab an eyeshadow in the colour of your hairroots and tip it into these white spots ;) looks immediately as if you would have wonderful thick Hair!!
Omg the pony tail trick!!!! Love
What color are you wearing on your eyes your make up looks amazing.
Awesome hacks 👍👍
Thanks for the tips. Glad I found your channel.
I thought shaving your face will only make your face grow hair even more
omg you are so perfect
I love that eyeshadow. Your makeup is nice, fresh, and natural.

Omg girl, you are beautiful! Stay true to yourself and let that inner beauty continue to shine. So sad when I see YouTube's beauty community admirable confidence turn into being fake 'n vein. I'm subscribing as you actually remind me of Nikkia Joy! I adore her! You seem so sweet and genuine. Thanks for the tips!
One tip I used to swear by when my hair was dark helped my hair to look thicker!
My favourite hack is to use clear brow gel to slick back my baby hairs or any frizz! But you probably already know that trick 😘😘
Thank you for sharing great video 👍🏾👍🏾
I think all the tips or helpful, and thank you for keeping the instructions simple👍
Excellent tips!  love em ..maybe except the faux freckles! lol!  Other than that love the white inner eye pencil and the ponytail under clip and the cuticle nail clip for faux eyelashes.  Great video!

Thank you for the beauty tips, beautiful
I LOVE the eyeshadow you used. Is there any other eyeshadow that is similar??? Since the one you used is discontinued :(
amei 😍
I like your makeup 😍😍
Thanks for sharing. Wish my makeup would be as stunning has yours. maybe with these tips😉
I know this is like 2 years old but I've been doing that ponytail clip trick for yeeeeaaars. Unfortunately from illness my hair has thinned a lot so I can't do this look anymore because you can clearly see the clip. I even tried the tiny ones but those didn't help either. But yeah it's a cool hack so your hair doesn't become damaged.
Freckles fade with age? Darling, you gotta be kiddin' me.
There is a huge difference in colour of your face and ears/scalp etc..
I almost thought this was a joke. Sometimes I watch videos while I’m putting on my make up and I looked up and it looked like everybody was sunburned. I don’t get it?
You are simply gorgeous! I have a question. You have beautiful brows. What do you use? What tips for brows when you are aging and thining brows happen?
i love how chloe goes right to the point and doesn't spend like 8 min babbling in the beginning of the video. her videos are so concise and fun to watch
Your eyes look amazing
How much makeup!!!!
Thank you Chloe, luv the tutorial..    - Esme
Where can I find the Dupe of this Eyeshadow?? . Its soo beautiful. But discontinued.
in women's make-up, I recommend using lavender oil over time to relieve stress and tension, as well as giving a pleasant smell to the nose.
What's a good dupe for the Elizabeth Arden Eyeshadow ❤? It's gorgeous
You are great. And a stunner. Thanks for the tips.
Bronzer, concealer, 1st then foundation
you so darn pretty girl. with or without all that makeup
bravo j'adore !!
Ok will do.  I love the makeup videos their really cool.
لايوجد عربي هونا😅
I came here thinking I was going to learn something new... I already knew everything she said.... I think I might have a make-up tutorial and tips addiction! I need to slow my roll lol! Finally one single palce that all these tips are for women!
I LOVE this video! Super helpful and informative!!!
Easy peasy to understand. Now I have to practice. Thank you!
Great video I will definitely be using some of those tricks x

Hey what Color of Make-up do u use? ❤️
She’s gorgeous and these tips are new!!!
You are so pretty chloe i love you 👍🏻
Perfeito só as pintinhas foram desnecessárias
Nii de coña me afeitó yo la cara!😨💨
Me encanta como se maquilla,solo la miro ya q no se ingles😭😭😭😭😭😭
shaving the face makes the hair thicker and darker, i suggest sugar waxing it as it lasts longer and the skin becomes softer,, other than that the makeup is perfect. 😍
Excellent tips 💕
I love #4 #7 and #12 will safe my mental state and alot of time hahaha. And could you please post a tutorial how to put on fake lashes, i always end with throwing them away hahaha
I have thin hair, like you, but you can’t tell! I’m going to do a couple videos on how to create super Volumous hair
This video had some really good tips. Most of them I hadn't seen before.
Your eyelashes look amazing
Brilliant!
loved it  thank you
I think they have silicone eyeshadow catchers, I can't remember but I swear seeing them on another video. Also, I simply do my face (foundation, etc) AFTER my eyes are done. shrug
You're gorgeous. And easy to watch. Not everyone is. Sorry that anytime someone trends they get a bunch of childish backlash and insults. This commentary thread is ridiculous (of course the majority of the comments are all wonderful). It's cringe inducing. For them. Kinda like the ridiculous hater at the club glaring over at the happy, carefree, beautiful girl rocking out and loving her life. We all see the mean looks. And we all see the envy. And it just makes us dance harder. Because we must be doing something right.
Хело хуб .🇹🇯🇹🇯🇹🇯
Dermaplaning! Yes! I love dermaplaning
Useful video, thanks. 
I love your tips and how unique they are!! the eyelash trimming, lip strobing, and freckles especially. I have watched a lot of makeup videos and havent heard anyone mention these tips. Thanks for sharing!

Love this makeup look!!
Она забыла в конце ролика усы нарисовать себе)
Love this video ❤
Omg thanks for the ponytail trick I have to use it
When you get any type of mascara anywhere you don't want on your skin, even if if you are in full theatrical makeup - use a q-tip, touch it to your face lotion so it is only barely damp and touch/blot the mascara mess up.  it pulls it away without completely having to redo your makeup.
You are amazing !!!!!!
You are soooo beautiful! Like a younger healthier Angelina Jolie! I mean she is amazing but u r even more so!
Chloe💕
This are old hacks i took since 30 years 😂
Omg. Such a flawless face! Just enjoyed looking at you and listening to your soothing voice. Hi from Bosnia and Hercegovina.

What is the use of make-up to make a beautiful face when your hair looks like crap!
love your video you are awesome ;)
all i saw is anne marie in black hair😍
I have veins on my upper lip and it looks like i have a moustache. I try to cover it and it makes it look worse. Ugh. Any suggestions ?  Your tips are so great for us that dont want to look like a painted doll❤
love the light outer liplining/blending n ive used the hairdryer FOREVER on my lashes-WORKS AMAZINGLY!!! I use a pr of small all metal embroidery shears for trimming strip lashes etc.sharp,small n thin!
U impressed me thinking of the environment. Very cool chick. Xx
I loved all hacks except the freckles hack. I personally love freckles but they didn't look natural to me.I will be trying out the lips hacks..good video all around.

Beautiful lips! Beautiful girl !😍

Someone back me up on this: does she or does she not have a slight comparison to Candice Swanepoel ?
You are just super glam ! Awesome - Keep Up.
Wow that Elizabeth Arden eyeshadow is gorgeous!
You are very beautiful without makeup...bellissima e brava!
very nice! thanks for your tips it really helps out
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
MY HAIR LOOKD BALD IN THE BACK LIKE YOURS.
I like to dab a little faux to enhance freckles just over the bridge of my nose. Ive used an orange/ brownish color lip pencil. Make sure it semi sharp. Try to keep them random. Freckles are not uniform and sometimes less is more. They do create a more youthful look and I like them just on the bridge of my nose where I have like two or three very light ones already. I always wanted freckles. Those girls who have them naturally, lucky you! 💕
These are great tips and you are beautiful! Do you have any tips for 40-50 year old women who's faces are starting to really age :(
❤️❤️❤️👏🏻👏🏻
Amazing tips! Thanx
до всех этих манипуляций была красивая девушка, такое количество макияжа только испортило естественные данные.
the tips were so helpful
Wow! I am so lucky finding your channel! How i love your videos!

Good ideas Cloe!👍...You're a beautiful woman!! Almost don't need any make up!!...thk God..😌👌...Thanks and blessings!!😁🌼🙏
Love this video. I love dermaplaning. Seriously.
Really helpful thanks
U are beautiful ~
I love you
eye shadow to fill in the gaps in your hair when wearing it up-  sounds unnecessary, really makes a huge difference
Mon dieu une femme qui se rase !!! Heureusement qu elle se met une couche incroyable de maquillage parce qu a force ses poils feront une ombre noire et aie aie quand on lui dira bonjour...ça pique !!!!🤣
Use  fill -in powder for your hair to cover the white bold patches 🤗
I loved your chanel! Bebeth Monteiro. From Brasil
waauw thank you
she is so pretty...that i see her in low resolution vídeo...cause to economize internet conextion...and still she looks perfect!
I cannot find the eyeshadow in this video anywhere. The ELIZABETH ARDEN one. @Chloe Morello, is there any other shadow in another brand which is similar?
🖤
Love you mom
Wow very useful 👏👏new friend please connect 😊

Great video!
I like it how she does her makeup💝💝💝💝

I watched alot of videos on the you tube but you are promoting self-motivation and gave your clients so satisfied and useful suggestion. Some people are obviously promoted above others though.This is very informative that have puzzled to solve their problems. I will definitely share your video with my friends. Thanks for sharing. Lots of love! Come to see our updation on https://youtu.be/3k6UepXB4aA
Oh she is so cute 💜
I’m pretty sure everyone does this but before tweezing your eyebrows, use the make up pencil and line out your eyebrows and tweeze the outside areas ❤️
I love EE.UU
😍😍😍😍
I like sofe makeup like this so prity
Thank youu 💕✨
Бляя ещё брить лицо не хватало. И кто вообще бреет пушковые волосы на лице? Большей тупости не видела
You're beautiful, and great makeup tips.... only problem is the unfair advantage that you already have. No makeup needed, lols!!!
What’s a dupe for the eyeshadow u used!!
Huge color line from your face to your neck, is that in these days? Look great otherwise!!! Thanks!
this strobing cream insted of a lipgloss tip is soooo useful, its crazy i have never thought of this bc honestly im not really on the matte lip bandwagon, i love glossy lips but those sticky products ewwwww..
You have an Angelina Jolie vibe going on.  I dig it
😍روعة
Good Thanks!!!!!! 😘😘😘😘🤗🤗🤗
Súper 😘😘
I was waiting for her to use powder or bronzer to fill in the ponytail above the ears where a lot of us have thinner hair.it's a beauty hack to appear more youthful and thickens appearance of hair but also something I figured out accidentally when I went overboard plucking my hairline and shaving peach fuzz. I had to cover the areas with bronzer that was back in 2005 way before beautitorials and makeup gurus I was in H.S. and didn't use internet much
It’s too much 💄 you are beautiful without makeup
oh my gosh these are such great ideas
I love your eye lashes 👍
it beautifull
Its nice 😍😍
Yay I do have freckles so I don't wear much foundation. I don't want to smother them. Very interesting. Thanks
If one only sees this video a year after it was released, how do we know, which video came out last year on June 7th, since YouTube for some stupid reason cannot put the videos in chronological order!!??
I might be insane but she gives me serious Katie Holmes vibes😍💗 great hack video!
You are perfect.
I love your style in makeup

Hi. You are so Lovely. Can You please please tell the names of the make up You use. Because it is Only not how you do, when the colors är so Nice I would like to buy them. Or Least have the color as a reference. Best reg. From Sweden. OH, I sorry, now i saw the small text.😳
All looked wonderful, except the freckles... they just don't work.
So I have tons of freckles how silly of me this is the first time I heard about fake freckles "Bible"
💟💟💟💟
Me encantó el tutorial
Wouldn't it be a cool idea if u do a video on what colour fits best for green, blue, brown eyes and a quick tutorial on how u would do a look an that?! And try it with contacts if u want! Love u and all of ur videos! You inspire me so much ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Enough is enough!
I will never look at feminine hygiene products the same way again!! 😄😄😄
Beautiful
Thank u
do you have hair loss?
Your so pretty with makeup and without xx
Panty liner! Good idea!!
Bad for the environment!?  1 paper cup from a fast food restaurant contains far more waste than a couple pieces of small paper for below your eyes. Your fine. Great video!
Love it .
Your nose is perfect!!!
😅
Does dermaplaning make the hair grow thicker and rougher? Really need to knoww

Ottimo！ mi piace. Ragazzuole se avete voglia venite a spiarmi ！
Very nice and informative 👌🏻
What type of eyelashes do you have on
I am 40 yrs old. Love wearing mascara! But Idk how to apply to the BK of my lashes. Not do I know how to correctly use an eyelash curler. I ALWAYS GET THAT CREASE... NOT CURL.
That was really cool...liked it ..100%
TIP: Using a lash curler immediately after having a shower will hold the curl better ❤️ p.s. Chloe your videos always give me something to look forward to 😘 love ya lots like jelly tots x
i love you
i love you
I LOVE the sanitary pad hack, I can NOT stand the idea of doing my eyes before my foundation, this is THE BEST idea I’ve heard in a long time. BLESS THE HACK VIDEOS 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Wonderful Tips!
I just loved this video! very good tips! thanks! love u Chloe! u are so beautiful!💜😘
The lip trick works for me !!
Don't feel bad using panty liners for make up, it's a disposable product. You can use them for anything you want regardless of what some fool has to say about it.
Where can i order that elizabeth arden bronze luster eyeshadow?
great tips...
Elle est malade de s enlever le duvet!
Good tips except for the Blow Dry Lash Lift (esp. on her false lashes) and the freckles.

Lol instead using sentry pad u can use scotch tape as a shedow guard😋
Beautifull
You are beautiful, I just didn't like the freckles.. they look weird not natural.
#14 are you kidding me?🤔🤔🤔🤣🤣🤣
Maura?
I like the idea about using concealer under the brow line.
HOW DO YOU APPLY ERASER? BEFORE FOUNDATION OR AFTER
Very nice and helpful video! much love from the Netherlands😘💞
She's really pretty
Do your eyeshadow before you do your foundation!!:D otherwise that pad will stick to the foundation u just applied... and then its ruined :/
Beautiful
I used to have freckles and hated them on me!
Sehr gut
Show everybody for me black eye liner.
Adorable- the lips tricks and the pony tail technique - brilliant. And faux freckles! I love it. Beautiful channel.
your beautiful and your much younger then myself I'm 61 do you ever have an older model? and when you shave your face does it cause black stubble eventually? Please answer me ty
Thank you for these hacks!! Your lashes are amazing.
Pretty cool hacks! Thanks
Buu con tanto estuco está pobre mujer alos 40 tendrá más arrugas q frena d cuncuna😂na mejor natural noma👍
shaving the face? she will become like a man in the future
What hair setting spray?
Great tips thank u! P.S. Is Elizabeth Arden on drugs!!! Why would they discontinue such a gorgeous eyeshadow!! Noooooo! So sad
Смыть все, отклеить и.......?
What a smart move to "shave" your face ;) if you do it long enough your hairs will become way stronger and BLACK! Please don't do that
I see where to get your products now. Sorry!
I have so much blonde peach fuzz that I get stubble when I dermaplane 😞
The freckles just look dirty on most.
WOW , you are very beutifull  .
I like the wet sponge for powder tip most.  Heating our eyelashes with a blow dryer, instead of a curler is a trick worthy of trying.
Sin maquillaje dos muy bella
Well done beautiful pretty lady
Читаю комментарии на русском и английском, - все англоязычные пишут восторженные комментарии с позитивом и благодарностью,  а все русские - сплошной негатив! Вот уж Менталитет!! Да, тяжело русским живётся, ничему не рады,  во всём ищут  минусы и считают своим долгом непременно это прокомментировать! Задумайтесь, народ 🤔🙄
😍👍
Never shave your face!!!!
You are so beautiful 
I am so dumbfounded over all of these negative comments. This is still one of my favorite looks on you to date. THOSE LASHES WOW
So beautiful
Ubeat that concealer on your lips u know.
You are so gorgeous 😍😍. New subbie
Chloe, what brand are your make-up sponges and where do you them? Also can you do a clip of all your favourite products that you use to create your basic day make-up? Just the main items, not everything, which I'd imagine is a very long list of products.
Is this the twin sister of Candice Swanepoel? They even got the similar accent
Love everything but the faux freckles. Makeup looks beautiful and I love your color selections.
love you 😍 very nice 👍 😍😍😍😍😍😍
What eyeshadow is that? It's very pretty on you
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👍
From where do you get the white lip liner?🙈
Love you, your vids and your beauty hacks!! 💕🙌🏼
Thanks
Freckles are NOT a fair skin trait!!! I have had freckles all my life and Im an indigenous woman from the USA, Im really dark  naturally and even darker in summer.....
LVOE THESE HACKS!!!
Removing hair, using the razor.. Won't it make them grow thicker?
you are my inspiration! thank you for these tips!! love you ❤
Great!
I want that eye shadow!!
Nothing beats with natural looks.. i must say.. less effort
I think that framing a face like yours with red hair would be super pretty...
You were called out for your use of panty liners as undereye aid to get a straighter line, because someone thought they were wasteful and harmful to the environment.  You have got to be kidding me!  FFS, they're cotton, bioldegradable and compostable (at least the ones I've always used are)....what about that is harmful to the environment??  They're in the same category to me as paper towels, TP or otherpaper products.
Wonderfull,you are the best😍😘🤩
excellent job. you are so beautiful
Что она делает, бреется?  Ужас, пусть лучше растут...
Макияж без тормозов))) я весь ролик кричала: и это ещё не всё?!!! Сначала заштукатурить веснушки и прыщи, а потом по свежей штукатурке рисовать веснушки и прыщи🤦🏻‍♀️ Красить тушью нарощенные ресницы, а потом к ним клеить ещё и накладные🤦🏻‍♀️
What I wouldn't do to look like this lady
Лайк за идею с крабиком
😱😱😱 I would NEVER shave my face, arms etc in any way or form omg! Shaved hair turns thicker and darker and once done your ruined for ever. Wow. Legs, arm pits etc is ok but the face!? That is for guys.
she is gorgeous!!!!!
Where do I get one of the face shaver things?
the following URL is chanique
Girl ur lips,,,kylie jenner is quaking
🤯 that's exactly what I do with my lashes and people would ask where you get them done when I told them there my own lashes and use a hairdryer to get them like that  they thought I was mad and that  using a hair dryer 😲😂. but it's actually a good way to make look big as you don't want to use eyelash curlers on your lashes after applying mascara as they would clump and using the blast on your hair dryer makes them look so dramatically long and fake  but there 💯% all natural try it out it really dose work I thought I was the only one that did this
You are awesome
Shave is the first step to wear a beard.
Awesome!! What bronzer are u wearing? It's a nice shade
God you’re gorgeous!
great hacks that actually work
Bad for the environment!? Whaaa? Thats what someone got from ALL of this GREAT tutorial? I can think of LOTS of  things worse for the environment than panty liners! Come on ppl, damn! Great video!
you are beautiful... if I buy you a house and a car will you marry me and bear my children?
Not sure why you would add freckles I put make up on the hide my freckles I think you definitely look better without the freckles
Shaving your peach fuzz doesn't make the hair grow back darker and thicker ?
Faux freckles...no!!!
u look so pretty
I am so afraid shaving my  faceon my own...Does your peach fuzz grow faster, stronger? Anybody knows or has expiriences? How often you do that?Thanks 💝
Bu yüze ne yapılsa çok güzel olur zaten maşallah
Great
Fantastic video...thanks
u r so pretty
You so beautiful 😍
Lovely
Love your eyeshadow color what brand is it please
She is beautiful
I love beautiful make up, but when it comes to the point where you need to do further make up touch ups to create more "natural" look (talking about freckles) it really goes waaay too faaar....wouldnt it be nice and simple to be natural from the core? too much make up is not nice
If I have that beautiful face,I really think dont need any make up,ur so nice and beautiful. God bless
Fake freckles aren’t cute and that contour is super heavy and needs to be blended.
Resmen tras oldu
are you wizard? my mind is blown
Very good.  Thank you.
I'd like to know how to pat on loose mineral foundation using either a beauty blender or velour puff. Also, since I have a pouty lower lip, I want to balance out my much smaller upper lip (I'm a lipstick hoarder, and lining my lips is tough) please - anyone - chime in with your tips and secrets!
U are gorgeous
I do like like your nails, any particular products?

i love you Chloé
Chloe, what is the eyeshadow that you are using on this video? Is it the same one that you're using under your lower lashes ?
Can anyone please inform me what is the best and professional brand for fashion eye lens I really am searching for the best and opaque quality and light colours specially with brown ochre Mel etc and some kind of a brand where’d celebrities would order from 🙏🙏🙏
Make up tips are great
So much make up, so much overreacting stuff...nothing beautiful about it coz at the end is just freaking fake....natural beauty is most beautiful beauty...

If you do foundation after shadow, you can clean up eyeshadow fall sprinkle.
Doesn't shaving cause the peach fuzz hair to grow back darker?..
superb
I wonder if fine facial hair will grow thicker and darker if you keep shaving them ... Im very light skin but dark hair so I'm worry. Appreciate Any thoughts & feedback!

Just a personal thought doesnt shaving your face will grow back more thicker hair? it might also enlarge pores and make hair more black. 🤔🤔🤔??otherwise love all the beauty hacks 😍
Que mujer mas antipática..!!😠
Beautiful
Freckles fade as you get older?!  lol  I have more freckles now than I ever did before.  That's what happens when you tan...

love this video, except for the fake freckles.  They look like blackheads instead.  :-)
LOL ...TO MUCH ABOUT BEAUTY !   SHOUPD BE ABOUT HEALTH ...BEAUTY ONLY SKIN DEEP .. BEAUTY  FADES !
My skin hates being caked this makeup is too heavy.time consuming,and probably expensive, the best way to show your freckles is use a lot less makeup.
You can heat up an eyelash curler with a blow dryer too before curling your lashes— be careful with the heat!
didn't your lash tech tell you to blow dry on cool setting after you get them wet or use a small fan ever?? Someone had to tell you?
Wow
She's a prettier Adriana Lima. Why doesn't she model?
can you help me I have no eyebrows and when I Rose I do have I got gaps in between them
With the first one i dont agry.
your eye lashes are real?

I also like my water line in white eye liner because I have smaller eyes. This makes my eyes appear bigger, but you gotta line it with some shadow on the bottom lid to make it look natural :)
your so pretty

1:18 NO NONONOOOOO!!! THE ADHESIVE ON PADS ARE NOT MEANT TO BE ON YOUR FACE!!!
Any small you tubers want to support eachother? :)
Can someone please tell me the equivalent to the elizabeth arden eye shadow?? I have been looking for this color for so long, but this particular item can not be bought anymore. Does anyone know where I can find this color???
You could also use tape if you done want to use sanitary liners.
Are you from wales
Nail clippers have bacteria from finger nails as well 	as toe nails.. I assume that using such tools to cut fake eyelashes and then placing them on the eye's is a good way to get finger & TOENAIL bacteria into the precious and sensitive eye's. Nice hack.
i like it
Wow she is beautiful
God tip, clip.under tail.
2:15 " I really love using this for no make up days". Really? No makeup? You sure about that? It's literally white eyeliner

You're my favorite... I'm gonna try your makeup tips today
Girls don't shave your faces! you can do that only if you are having laser sessions! if you are not then DON'T SHAVE
Very good video. Stright forward n no annoying voice or trying to look cute. Though im not wearing much make up im still enjoy watching it. Btw do u have 10 mnts make up tutorial especially when rushing to work make up?
luv luv luv
Tip #17 - don't go too heavy on the foundation, especially if you have very short hair, or you have long hair that you want to pull up/off your face.  
you're so pretty! you look exactly like Angelina Jolie
Great tips
Plz learn us how to put lashes, it’s too difficult for ne
painting freckles on your face to make it look like less makeup?????why wouldn't you just wear no makeup.....talk about a ridiculous thing to do
What is ur hair colour in this video it’s so nice , do u dye it ?

Are you serious?did you save your face;?????omg!!Tragik
How long are your eyelash extensions?
Good video
Just an FYI freckles are not a "fair skin trait" ..
🧔
A Natural beauty with 1 mm painting on her face. Why? I know it is a way of making money but try and get passed skin depth and  how others see you (for sure not inspiring) At your age silicone lips, Botox, etc. How sad...
Do you getstubbly or prickly if you derma plane? I really want to do my cheeks but I’m scared of becoming prickly 😂
امثوةوو
You are gorgeous😍😍
Awesome tips
ВЫ ТАКАЯ КРАСИВАЯ И БЕЗ МАКИЯЖА В ЧАСТНОСТИ.СУПЕР ЛИЦО ВАШЕ.ХОЧУ ТАКОЕ ЖЕ.....
You are so sweet and fun to watch.
Very nice .Thank you for video . What you doing that your eye lashes are very long ? And is your lips are naturally aswell or did you make injections ? Thank you
Likeeee
Bravo
what color lipstick are you using- it looks great.
Amazing what people can do with makeup. I've only ever worn eyeshadow and liner. Anything else makes me feel like I'm suffocating my skin. As for the freckles, I used banishing cream from Avon in the 90's to try and get rid of them, and here people are adding them!
Does the hair on your face grow back thick?
ur skin is so pale without makeup but why u use always darkest product? i don't know why? it looks too fake damn!
What is the name of the eyeshadow
Побрила белые Вырастут чёрные
Fabulous 
Très bon pour la planète les protégés culottes 😳
Her face looks too cakey.
Pretty
what a hell???
😘😘😘😘👍👍👍👍👍
eyes are beautiful
If you are reading this girls,! Don't try the first one were you shave your face, your peach fuss will get thicker and thicker every time you do it! And then it's going to look like you have a beard!DON'T DO IT!
You are Candice Swaneopal's doppleganger!
Súper cool 😎
I like your eyebrows.
nice and normal tips. thanks
I do not understand the logic behind shaving your face what the hell girls these days freak me out, hey hunny I can't imagine you 5 years down the line if you carry on shaving your face. A very bad example for all the ladys out there
Is there a dupe for the EA bronze lustre eyeshadow?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzrIJKMvaXg
она и без косметики очень красивая
Hi, shoud you not wax instead of shaving. Shaving has a tendency to stimulate hair growth. They will only come back stronger and there will be a lot more. x
crazy eyebrows
Она похожа на Анна Мари
Have you tried MakeUpHolic liquid matte lipstick? Try it it’s on Amazon
You look too orange
Great hacks...except the "faux freckles" look like blackheads to me.
Freckles DO NOT FADE WITH AGE. actually they get worse with age bc exposure to the sun makes them darker. I would know I've had them my whole life and I'm 46
Shouldn't the make be natural instead of having a makeup line . With her hair up u can see how much lighter her skin is ..
Hai lo stesso cognome della famiglia materna del mio ex marito....sei bellissima e bravissima....
Wrinkles wasn't a good idea... 
U r so much similar to Anne Marie
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSgzNpEPFeGzeN7hwn6RpHQ
Which lashes do you wear?
Wow
She looks nice but too fake,  I don't like it for myself
are you crazy - shaving your face? don't do that please. better trim it with the thread
DO NOT shave your face, EVER. Unless you like that 5:00 shadow🤮
Your makeup was applied beautifully but your foundation is just way too dark. It looks like you fake tanned your face. It just does not match your real complexion therefore it looks like you have on way too much makeup. You are beautiful, you really don't need so much. Just try cutting back a little at a time and notching the shade back by mixing in some concealer to lighten the shade of your foundation.
Hate the Freckles😬🤯
My Goodness. How much of your face you hid behind this crazy makeup!
Your are beautiful
Why r you self dark sportss on yr fce  whyy i dnt undrstndd yrr
Меня одну бесят нарощенные ресницы?
You are very beautiful
OMG!! That is a lot of really thick orangey foundation & concealer, your skin must be completely clogged underneath it all! The freckles just looked like bits of dirt or dropped flaky mascara. I think you'd look quite pretty with way less make-up. Your eyebrows looked nice though.
What is your mascaras name?

Don't use too much makeup lol. Natural beauty is the best way to look great.
Outside the makeup room the Planet is dying...
Can you please do a video about only products that don’t test on animals/ vegan products and which are the best to use?
The freckle look😐
Надо же какая красивая девушка
You look so tired
Mu szempillaval én szebben neznek ki, bekepzelt picsa, teteti magát 😂😝😝
What are you wearing on your eyes?????
I like everything but the freckles.  You aren't the freckle kind of complexion. It doesn't look right.
What color/brand is your eyeshadow please
You were way hot before you put on the makeup.
I use a few Bobby pins to hide the clip under the pony tail. Just use a piece from the under side of each side and pin under clip and spread the hair.

Is that your natural lashes??😱
0:14 - What the hell??? Isn't enough to shave our legs, armpit, and who knows what... should I shave my face too? This is abnormal... Brrrr... Your fuzz will be bigger after some shaving... xD
Your biggest advantage is that you are just simply beautiful. I enjoyed your cosmetic hacks and I thank you for kindly sharing your beauty secrets with us. Brava!
lots smart idea,
U r so cute
I just use business cards/credit cards for that sharp eyebrow line. not wasteful BC you reuse it for next time, I have one specific card in my makeup box for this so I can use daily if I wanted

Yeah, using a pad to do your eye shadow is really going to destroy Earth and turn it into a ball of flames. We're all gonna die in, what is it now, 12 years according to Occasional Cortex.

Never shaved your face..  In time will be more

Man! She looks like a million bucks without any foundation!!!! Flawless skin! Why isn't she world famous like jolie or kim kardhasian?
Does anyone else think she strongly resembled Angelina Jolie with her makeup!? She looks beautifully done.
Wow! I love each of them! 👌🏼Thanks
what colour/brand eyeshadow did you use ?
Yes but what if for some reason she can't get that survey thingy and she gets a beard
What color is your eyeshadow ....very pretty
4:16 = even if u get tanned, your neck and the part behind your ears reveal it. your orange is way too orange
Es muy bonita, para mi es demasiado maquillaje, solo apto para una fiesta o fotos publicitarias.
