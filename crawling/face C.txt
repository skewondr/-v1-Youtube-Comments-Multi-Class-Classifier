My ears bled after hearing the song over and over again for 10 mins straight
7:18 SO NO ONES TALKING ABOUT HOW SMOOTH THAT TRANSITION WAS
Tiktok is dededede
society: why are you having trust issue for no reason?
These tiktoks called me ugly in every chinese character
Them: * takes off glasses and looks cuter*
The 7:20 girls transition was so satisfying lol. It blended so well.
1:39 OMG 😱😱 He really looks like Dylan Wang😍
Why do they make it seems as if glasses is a bad thing ...
Is no one gonna talk about the girl at 9:01 she's very pretty and after the transfromtion she looks very pretty. Like in olden era's
Naah I don't feel ugly after watching this
5:26 omg he's so cute wonder how he's gonna-
6:14 doesn’t even have to change HES beautiful
7:20 me: she's already gorgeous so what's she gonna do---
everyone in the comments 
1:22 tell me he doesn’t look like hit man bang..
Why is no one talking about the girl from 3:51 she was beautiful to begin and she made herself even more beautiful
Honestly I'm Asian and I dont look this beautiful, I'm just a rotten potato
0:40 in his before looks
5:23 
1:10 
2:13 The boy he's actually cute
4:53 Like literally I can tell he was going for a cute look AND HE DID I WAS ATTACKED—
Now I understand why people need makeup
so we’re not going to talk about the fact the guy in the thumbnail looks like mark lee-?
The two Dylan Wangs (1:40, 2:50), epic hair flip girl (7:18) and tomboy at 6:15 😍🌸
Never TRUST that DADADADDA...
No one: 
0:42 he looks like a N. Flying' member
The one licking lollopop is actually cute before and after
0:41 Oh my god his hair sooo cute and he was already cute what did he have to change😪🥰🥰
Every one says about how cute he/she is 
the real version in life of 'the sevret of angel' webtoon lol
me at the first minute : wow this looks fun 
0:48 i've replayed this over and over why am i seeing a lil bit of taehyung
This is why you should play water fight on your first date.
This proves that make-up can drastically change a person's appearance.
5:01 im in love 😍 before and after
Is anyone gonna talk about him  0:10 his transformation is everything
second one shocked the hell out of me.
Most of the boys are not that ugly without makeup.
0:38
7:23 that was...so beautiful omg I can't stop repeating
I muted this video. Can't handle this song for another 8 minutes.
this sorta proves my point on how most Asians on very strict on beauty
3:31 she is super cute, like she doesn't even needs to put a lot of makeup because she is already very pretty (I'm totally cRuShEd)
Who is irritate of this sound?
3:11 is the kind of tik tok when u know ur face aint pretty enough so u show ur body instead lmao
am i weird for like the guys at 0:40 better before than after? 
0:18 I THINK IM IN LOVE OMG
0:41 
3:09 On the left Yoongi is that you?
Honestly Chinese girls are pretty
0:42 he came prepared, he's still handsome without the transformation😲
2:14 HE DOESNT NEED TO CHANGE HES ALREADY CUTE OMFNDHHDJDJSKDJSBS HELP UWUWUWUUW
My older brother said: That's why I can't trust Asians
Why do they all look like anime characters after their transformation >.>
no one gonna talk about that collar bone attack-
No one going to talk about how adorable the girl at 2:51 is
Other countries: You look better without glasses
So seriously nobody talks about this magic trick? 0:51
7:17 can we just apreciate that transition tho!
1:29 he looks alot like Choi Min Ho from SHINEE😱😍
0:10 weird asian kid to kpop idol
OMG even boys know how to put makeup while me I'm struggling how to put lipstick properly
3:21 he looks like he could be RM's father😂😂
I want koreans vs chinese do these things😂

The second one got me like 😲
4:53 Damn that smile tho. I wanna be that lollipop so bad 😍😂
@1:39 
0:48
7:45 finally! Someone who believes their "attractive" version includes glasses.
0:41 💙 2:43 💙
2:38 is that the perfumer from IDV?! i'm dying now i will never trust a girl with big eyes and too very whiteee😭😭😂❤
1:18 wtf I almost choked on my drink
1:38 i guess dylan wang doesnt have a unique face huh?
all the boys who transformed to a girl looks better than me
Here’s a tip: turn the volume all the way down if you are still persistent on torturing yourself with this out of pure boredom
2:49 why does he look like younghoon from the boyz?
0:30 She was a senior high student in our school btw
1:32

1:37 he looks so much like Dylan wang😂😂
Tô bugada ;-; misericórdia, fiquei o vídeo inteiro dizendo "num pode ser" mano, eu nunca vou entender a Ásia na minha vida!
2:14 dustin from china.
4:57 he looks exactly like my classmate, when he transforms, it looks more like my classmate
0:42 i think this boy it's look handsome without make up..

0:41 He reminds me of N.Flying Jaehyun.
1:38  holy sheet I was not ready for this
When I saw the baby I was so scared they were gonna add the makeup😰
The transformation was very perfect but the music was annoying
1:40 he looks like Daoming Si after

Others : my ears bleeding hear it
2:53 ; 3:30 ; 3:50 Just a good looking girl wearing some makeup 
3:31 she goes from pretty to PRETTY
The one during 2:00 has the most natural transformation. Like she just added a bit makeup and all but still its just pretty much enhancing her features. well done
3:34 the most normal after that. life changed my perception of makeup
1:21 was HoT before and after

Are they the same person after transformation I wonder 🤔
Is the first girl in this video chinese?
The most surprising was for me was 0.56 mins one😅
1:39 He looked like Dylan Wang!!
I've lost my faith in beauty
tbh the guy at 0:41 is still cute even before the transformation 0w0
4:53 guy really got me crazy with his alluring smile! No need for transformation just smile lovely  😉

:40 is PERFECT for me
4:54 Honestly i'll take both thanks :)
Ok but a some of these ‘transformations’ are 100% two different people.
3:10 like first glance i was shocked of how he looked like BTS yoongi
I want to know their secret OMG! I’m Chinese and I don’t know how they change their look so much with only make up
best transformation. i love it♥️GOD BLESS YOU PO.

I think this trend is so wholesome, I've never really seen any make up transformations featuring guys! a lot of guys don't understand that make up isnt girly, it's transformative.
6:15   looks like Jungkook
OK out of all, 5:51 was the best so far. That was so heart warming
Just once, I want the person in the vid to look the exact same after “transforming,” wonder wtf went wrong, then just shrug it off and carry on.
6:15 what in the world r u doing here boi , you already freaking handsome the only thing he did was revealed his forehead and eyebrows (what I saw) do you see the power of eyebrows and forehead.
3:33
