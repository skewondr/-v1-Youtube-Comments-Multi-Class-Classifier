This music: EXISTS
I think this girl's been trolled too much... why does everyone hate this song? 
2019?no?ok good bye :-(
Who was watching this in 2019 October 12
Poor girl, I can’t even imagine the amount of times she may have questioned life because she had to hear people tell her that kill herself, it’s honestly so sad how the world can just put others down so effortlessly...
WTF is with watching older songs in October 2019? Every other old song I've watched now including despacito and roar have comments about watching in October.
Her: makes song at 13
hey guys dont be rude like this dont dislike ont
No offense but her voice sounds like Squidward that becomes a girl
comments in 2011: “there’s only one seat tho”
Teacher: How was your weekend?
Why is there so many goddamn people watching this in October 2019?
Who watching this on Friday of 2019

The autotune used to scare me when I was younger 😧

It feels weird watching when you know the story behind this video.

I know there's a lot of dislikes but adleast this is popular
Plot twist:

Now I wonder what could have happened if she chose Super Woman instead of Friday
This should bring back many memories from the early to mid 2010's
Just came here to see the likes or dislike, like if you are  here for the same thing 😘
qui ecoute ça en 2019
that’s a nice like/dislike ratio
Who's here after the BuzzFeed video? 
Shes older. Hopefully she can remix into a better song.
The most horrifying thing I will see in all of October
She went on the four and the judges loved her and she was 13 in this, so all y’all needa stop judging on her, cuz she better then ever and y’all judged her too soon cuz she has a beautiful voice now
dude this song is the bomb!! why 3million dislikes??
I honestly never hated her song but after coming back from BuzzFeed, I really felt bad for her...
most of this is just explaining when friday is, and what comes before and after it...such an inspiration to kids.
Its monday.
2019?
Shes teaching us the days of the week😂didnt know i was still a todler.
This is how many people came back after watching the video “I sang the song “Friday” from BuzzFeedVideo..
Plot twist: she's unknowingly trapped in a time loop and won't be freed until Bill Murray bangs his new producer.
Why does she got so many dislikes? 😭 Thats so sad..
2019?
una pvta basura
I feel so bad after watching that buzzfeed video😭
This vid has more dislikes than likea
Why does she look like the girl in dr phil when she thought she was preggo with baby jesus or she thinks her dad is eminem or just me?

It’s Wednesday 8th October 2019 and I came back to this song to redo my dislike I placed 7 years ago
Anyone else who came from the 10 most disliked videos

My 9th Grade history teacher played this every Friday at the beginning of class
Am i the only one from europe who never heard from this song and found ir by accident or through memes and doesn't know why it has so many dislikes and thinks this song isn't even that bad?
Who has just dislike this video in 2019 ?

You might ask yourself... how did this comment get 20k+ likes???
3.5 million DISLIKES???????????????????????????????? its a cool song
“Gotta make my mind up, what seat can I taaake” 
someone seeing in 2019?
To think.. that some executive somewhere, told this poor girl that this was good. So much evil in The World.
I can't watch this video knowing that after this a 13 year old girl fell into deep depression
I screamed this at school every friday
Her smile so hard it hurts my jaw just watching
I'm here in 2019 and just saw Rebecca Black sing for the first time, so I came to see what the talk was about.  Rebecca Black, in 2019, I don't care how many dislikes this video has, you win the internet!
Todos delen su dislike que se merece
Now that I know that rebeca and her friends were 13 at that time, watching that video made me realize that those kids aren’t old enough to drive.
I like the part where she says "its friday."
I LOVE THIS SONG😁😁😁😁😂😂😂😂😀😀😀😎🤗😇
She speaks like a robot and it’s scary
I like how it has 3.5 mil dislikes and 1 mil likes
nobody:
October 2019
Still really gay lame in 2019 (bet the homies feeling da pain )
1:11 trying to act like the cool girls, Oh forgot, they’re not
the fact that she got death threats for this is sad. she was in middle school when she did this. can u imagine how sad and scared she must have been ? and y’all making jokes about this ? this world is just sad.
When she said “yesterday was Thursday, today is Friday” I felt that
Who else has those couple of girls who sings this in the middle of class? 
When she said Friday...
Who else is looking in the comments to see if there is any hate comments
they are 838K comments if you find mine you have a year of luck like to activate
Finds out they were 13 at the time of the recording
Woow! 1M Like vs 3,5M Dislike 😲
I love you!!!
I was deployed in Iraq when this went viral. As dumb as this song is, it gave me and everyone else in iraq a much needed laugh. We ended up singing this song every Friday LMAOO until we redeployed
After this I felt like banging my head on a concrete wall while listening to old town road for 27 hours
Who came here right after watching her explain this on buzzfeed?!
Actually, This Was Made On Saturday
I don’t feel bad for saying this is a decent song
Melhor música do mundo
Who is still watching this?
100% of the comments now: I came here from the BuzzFeed video!
I honestly wish I had watched this back in middle School when it first came out but I didn't
I watch the full song
Like si vienes de JuegaGerman
Me noticing a 13 year old was driving the car...
The fact that the internet ruined her life is utterly disgusting
Its Vendredi ! Its Vendredi ! Gotta get down on Vendredi ! (Merci Antoine Daniel)
I only added a like bcause she had too many dislikes unfortunately
The song really isn't that bad... It's a 14 year old singing an age-appropriate song.
Watching this video on Friday, October 11,2019.
This is the amount of people that came from the buzzfeed video
This song reminds me of my child hood I would. Listen to it like every Friday with my mom when I was 6 
Happy Friday Rebecca😀 I love Friday

Nunca vi tanto dislike
Who ever came from buzzfeed hit the like button to see who came from buzzfeed

もはや低評価推しに来てるやついそう
I usually hate the, "who's here on/in - --" comments, but I actually can't believe how many people are here in September and October 2019 😂
All the dislikes are from the ppl who took the bus
اثبتو وجودكم يا عرب بالايك
Me: Scrolling down to see dislike to like ratio bull crap
Im here cuz i just wanna annoy my parents
Why all these dislike?!!
it's not like she wrote the lyrics. straight up adults wrote this. people shouldve been mad at them, not at her 🙃
I still remember watching this 8 years ago 😪😿😿
Im in 4th class and everyone in my class sings that randomly at home time when its friday
oh dios mio que es esto buscando los videos con mas dislikes y me aparece esto 
cancer: the song
I only just now realized how dirty they did her with those lyrics 🤭
YouTube just called this girl not mature. She just sounds like a robot to me.
it is 2019 and I still do not know what to think of this song
So we are gonna ignore the first 16 sec of weird background noises😂😂
This is the first time I’ve watched this and I finally understand
This is how many people that came from the buzzfeed video 
Adults: wrote this song.
3.5m likes ain’t that bad. Just ask Youtube Rewind.
“Getting down on friday.....fun fun fun fun”😂
Who 2019??
When you realize there’s a guy rapping after 7 years
This is so totally my jam
I just loved the song when it was released 🇧🇷👍🇧🇷👍🇧🇷
She recorded this when she was 13 but she looks older 😂
Who else is here to read the comments
This was all made out of fun, she was just 13 and the hate is just too much. 
Alguém veio aqui só para ver likes negativos ???
I remember when the song came out - it was a Friday themed nice beat.  But, the shrill voice and ridiculous lyrics.  My ears have been raped.  I really wish I could unhear this.
Chilling to this on a Friday night.
no brain = people that comment who's watching this
dear rebecca, I’m sorry,i was young and dumb
c e r e a l
2019 anyone¿
2019)) just to check out this bizarre music
How did she even have a career, wtf 😂😂😂
Anyone else came here after the buzzfeed video ans forgetting how the song went? No, just me? Alright ... Hope you have a great day tho😂✌
Me: “i remember this song being really good”
Dang that is a lot of dislikes
Who thinks that youtube should add "oldest comments" for the comments filter just to see the 2011 comments on this video
Friday 2019 ??
I lowkey feel sooooo bad for her after watching that Buzzfeed video
Who else tryin to find comments from 7 years ago?
I feel bad for her she had to be homeschooled because of this video
This song wasnt even that nas 😔
2:00
Steps to sound like her
This song gave my depression depression
who still watching in 2019?
Aguante Argentina loco que ingles 🤣
Poor girl
No mames 😭😭mi infancia
I just wanted to shut down my immune system and it worked well. Oh lord this is the worst!
I swear this video had more dislikes and views
This is cringier than I remember 🧐 didn’t know that was possible
Hated the song when I was a kid (probably because radio hits at the time were abysmal and I was immature) but now it's just fine (not special, but definitely not worth the hate). We all grow up eventually. Rebecca, I hope you slam the haters.
3.5m DISLIKE girl delete this video
This song is even worse than eating shaving cream
2019.. Who's here...
Are we going to ignore the black beast singing like that...
It's a real shame that she was just a one hit wonder, after splitting with the producers of this song she could never recapture what it is that made her a viral sensation. Terrible mismanagement of what could have been a pop icon...
there was so much thought put into the lyrics at 2:04
1:21 ”my friend is by my right”
Damn bro why so much dislike
probably still one of the few good songs made after 2010^^
I like
My teacher had a whole entire lesson on this song.
Damn she fire with dem lyrics
WHY YALL HATIN SIS
1M likes compared to the 3.5M dislikes
En mi vida había visto más dislikes que likes en un video de una cantante "profesional" epico
I'm actually starting to enjoy it
Damn she was 14 when she dropped this
But its a nice song .
Her voice just sounds weird
who else came to see rebecca's cringey video lmao, and also the dislikes, ppl u are lit
My math teacher plays this every Friday......... help
My cousin sent me this on text and she’s like “happy Friday ally!” 
I had missed this song's first assault on humanity. Sadly, my brother was a traitor to the human race and sent me the link a couple weeks after the song became a thing. I became another victim.
She still looks like she got bad diarrhoea during the entire clip.
Lmao knowing that grown ass adults wrote this makes me laugh
The song is great why does it have this many dislikes
i know no one cares about first but at 2:44 look at the guys earring disappear
She has 3.5M dislikes and only 1M likes😢😒😒
I love this song actually ♡♡
I sleep well at night knowing I never hated on Rebecca in any way, shape or form
this song was a mistake.
"Gotta make my mind up, which seat can I take?" Ah the dilemma.
Who's else watching in 2020 (trying to get a head start on the year trolls)?
I wasn't popular. Was never invited to parties.       Cool song, though. lol
When she said “tomorrow is Saturday and Sunday comes afterwards” I felt that
this was posted on a saturday
Everyone else: This deserves a dislike
We are now having a funeral for head phone users
Well, she’s famous now bcz her haters
Adults actually wrote “Yesterday was Thursday, Thursday, Today is Friday, Friday.” And got paid for it. Wow
Is this the kind of music people were listening to?
I just learned that this is the worst song ever
I sing this everyday FRIDAY T.G.I.F.🥵💙😍
Who else came back in September to see how much dislikes she got?
Everyone is talking about how they came from buzzfeed but all I'm thinking is, who tf is that black dude??
Came here after discovering her new song  “anyways” ( which is actually really good) from part one of  the beautiful life of Jeffrey star.    
Tbh I never hated this song actually kinda liked it.
its saturday its saturday its saturday we dont have weekends of friday Xd
It's so funny how she has more dislikes than likes
i’m scrolling forever trying to find comments from 7 years ago
Just come back here to disliked
I- I listen to this every Friday
I love this song!
Why so many people hating on this? This is a good song.
“tomorrow is saturday, and sunday comes afterwards”
WILD ASIAN DAD: MUST STUDY
Nobody:
buacala :v
i-
I like Fortnite
THIS IS THE MOST ANNOYING SONG EVERRRR!!!!!!!
Why does she keep telling me it's Friday? It's only Monday! I really hope she makes up her mind about which seat to sit in, that's a really tough pickle to be in.
So nostalgic this is . The time was 2011, I was in 5th grade when this came out . so many memories of my elementary school days * sigh *
Y’all should listen to her sing now. She’s amazing!
“gotta catch my bus”
It's certainly not my kind of music but I would never make the kind of shitty comments so many loser cocksuckers have made hiding behind their avatar's. Most of them have never even tried to record anything like this young lady did. I have no respect for anyone who hides behind an avatar and bully's other people. Those kind of people are cowards and have no respect for themselves or others.
Man y’all cap this a banger
I like it, but why this have more dislikes that likes?
I feel sorry for the black dude
I used to make fun of this, but now I just feel bad. If you don’t know what I’m talking about, watch the buzzfeed vid
Who here is big brain?
мне нравиться когда она говорит friday friday 😀😀
Me on a Friday:  Mum I wanna become a singer and write a song.
How bullying works
2019
Who else is randomly watching this on a Friday? :/
I just searched up the most unlike video on YouTube and this is what I find
this is relatable no joke
2011 me: Dislike
October 16th 2019
She was 13 when filmin this... her frnds just casually have a car😂
Also she said she was 13 so the kid driving is probably also 13 💀
3.5M dislikes? Wow...
Looking back at this 8 years later, im pretty sure this was supposed to be a joke
she kinda sounds like a chicken ;-;
日本人いますか？(T . T)

The Company who made the lyrics is literally shit tbh. I feel bad for Rebecca :/

Rebecca black - the great divide (crash cove remix)
Why does everyone hate this song? It’s a meme! I love memes!!
Anyone came here to check the dislikes? Me  lol
me remembering this video  😐😯
For those of you know why her voice sound bad in this song it's because she's 13 and she was going through puberty and because during these time a lot of change and transformation in a teenage (body, behavior, voice,etc...) go through so it's probably was a factor why her song didn't get the credit it deserve.
Plot twist: filmed on Monday
I switched from a dislike to a like.... LET'S HELP HER GET MORE LIKES
Friday 🗣
Hey Failboat!
Todo mundo é russo fodase

The legend says that she is still confused about which seat she can take...
Wait everyone bullied a 13 year old girl but didn’t say anything about that grown man agreeing to throw a rap in there knowing better?👀

No offense to 8th grade Rebecca, but was this intentionally funny?

This is my favourite song to listen to when I feel like killing myself, it reminds me that life can be worse.
So she gotta “catch the bus” 0:31 and then her friends just come. Why add that to the song then?
There's a warning that says no mature content 🤭🤭🤣🤣

Quem veio por causa do Felipe Neto?
I Never disliked this video in the first place because she really didn't deserve the hate but I frickin LOST IT when she said "tomorrow is Saturday and Sunday comes afterwards"idk why I laughed so much
The only cool thing I found is the very beginning where some iconic songs are quoted. Other than that.. ehh.
Honestly watching this back and knowing that she was only like 13/14 and in middle school, this song isn’t the worst
I don’t hate the song but I hate the company.
Honestly it's not that bad,the autotune just ruins it.
I love fry-days

At a conservative estimate of $2 per 1000 views (current Adense/Youtube ad rates), this terrible video has made over $250,000 as of October 2019.  Not bad for such a steaming pile of **

We all hate this song but let's see if we can get more likes than dislikes...
My school plays this in the hallways every Friday. It gets really annoying
Rebecca : i have 3,4 millions dislike 
Y’all whoever is hating it’s rude. I honk she did amazing. Your just bringing her spirit down. If I could I would give her 10000 likes. Stop hating and inspire her to do more songs like this.
Mano q música horrível kkkkkkkkk

Reaction Time anyone?
Dear Rebecca
This song has more dislikes than likes haha lol
I'm so used to mumble rap now that this doesn't even sound that bad to me anymore in 2019.
Y thers I more unlike than liking it
“Which seat can I take?” You can only take the backseat the front is clearly full
This song gave me cancer
Y’all can hate all you want, but I know this was your childhood.
I come here every Friday!
when a 14 yr old has more subscribers than you (Jojo siwa)
What's so bad about this song?
Actually, it's Sunday. Friday was the day before Saturday, which was yesterday. And today comes afterward.
Producers: How much autotune you want 
Rebecca: at the bus stop
The rap part is kinda dope though but still overall I like this song is kinda catchy too.
where's the mod that makes minecraft zombies into rebecca black
Okay this song aint even bad💀💀
Solo vine a darle dislike keria ser popular xd
Wow No kidding this song is  really terrible
Who's here because its friday
She copied annoying orange tuse and said partying partying yeah and said its fry day get it Friday  fry day ha
Am I the only one who things about failboat and purplesheps Friday? 😂😂😂
All dislikes girl you should quit
Anyone here from glee? I loved Puck and Sam in the song but the originale really sucks...they were able to make this trash decent
its friday
I’m dead Brooke
Everyone please undisliked this video! Who agrees
I love her but only as a person even though her voice annoys the heck out of me. I heard this song when one of my teachers played it back when I was still in school & I had to leave the classroom. The only part of this song that I like is the rap but as far as the rest of the song it's a dislike from me. Ya know, Jesus commands us to love one another which I do but it doesn't mean that we have to like any of their songs or agree with what they do or say so I love her but I dislike this song.
this does not deserve 3.5 million dislikes, what made you people even dislike it?
Why is this video so hated? This a hella good rave song
Thank you Rebecca I have a song I can use for my school alarm.
Sitting up in the back seat but girl you standing

Anyone just came here from the BuzzFeed vid?
Anyone watching this on a Friday
My sociology teacher plays this song EVERY!!! Friday🤦‍♀️

All the likes came from David Devils vlog. 😂
At this point I feel like everyone came directly here after watching the buzzfeed video 😂
I saw 3.5m dislikes and disliked it without any cause, i guess most of you have done the same
Who's here to check out the dislikes??
Just came to see the dislikes 🙄
My last brain cells during the exam
Every Friday i play this song at work in full volume.
When you sniff sugar but it’s not actually sugar
Admit it. You're here from buzzfeed.
Anyone come here after reading about this song in a marketing book called Contagious? Sort of wished I hadn’t come now.....
The way she smiles and never looks away from the camera makes me feel threatened
I love this song!!!
Who was just seeing the views but was lowkey bumping they head 😂
Sorry I'm not really into this stuff. Can someone explain to me what this video has so many dislikes?
It's funny how everyone hates this song but every single Friday someone sings it

Holds up 8 years later.
After listening  to her most recent songs.I realized how much her voice has matured and she sounds so good 🤗
I actually like this song!
How the actual hell did this get 1 million likes??
Dani Cohn makes me wish 13 year olds still dressed their age and made music like this again ngl.
I just noticed that the rap part. Nobody ever talks about that guy
* Goes to a bus stop *
The sad part is that it makes me nostalgic
So what day was it again?
She didn’t even go to school she just skipped😂
Let's be honest the biggest problem with the song are the lyrics... And now that I know a company wrote that for her... I guess it wasn't her fault at all.
love it.. m gnna save this song
September 2019????
I listen this song on friday😭🤗😂
